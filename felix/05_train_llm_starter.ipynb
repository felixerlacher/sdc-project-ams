Little did anyone know (but, later, little was anyone surprised) that Lucrezia was spending her wealth on dark research, and against city law she made a pact with a Deep One. If she could build such power on wealth alone, why, imagine what she could build with the secrets of those pretending to be gods - would she not triumph over them all and become one herself? However, her dark dealings also set her upon a path of paranoia and secrets, so that by the time the courts came to arrest Lucrezia for embezzlement, she shocked them all by burning down her mansion, setting curses upon anyone who'd dare touch her, and generally being a nuisance until a team of specialized wizards successfully captured her. She has since, in a fit of nervous breakdowns, cut her hair, renounced her name to become Violante, and plotted her ascension to godhood with more fervor than ever.\n",

The family also had a specific clientele.  They must have been relatives since they all had the Smith surname, despite being many different races.  As he grew up he learned these guys were assassins and that his family was selling poisons to them.  These were small time assassins that lived around the area.  When Poshment came of age to take over the family business, he decided to leave in the middle of the night and go to the large city of Magnimar.  Once in the town, he joined the bardÕs college.  Once there he made up a new family and came up with a new name, filled with lots of relatives that all led interesting lives.  He completely changed his look so that he would not be recognized in his home town.  He went back with one of his new personas to Wartle.  No one recognized him at all.  This meant he was ready for the world.  He decided to make money he would seduce influential or rich and get secrets and money.  Never would he black mail anyone, but he would sell these secrets to anyone willing to pay.  This brought him to the island town where a particular half giant wife lived.

      "I am writing this now to help straighten out what I know and am learning into a logical fashion.  My story  is one of  bizarre coincidences to be sure.  First off my familyÕs legacy of a magical bow is mine without any instructions.  I know my elven relatives are quite affronted by my  motherÕs temerity in naming me as the bearer of the bow.  I know that it has a long and involved history, even if I donÕt know what that is.   It is a family heirloom.  The one obvious thing that it does is magically create itÕs own arrows.  I know it glows sometimes but I havenÕt decided if it glows around danger or evil, to me or it.  My teacher I think knows more but chooses not to tell me for promises to my parents who were great friends of hers.  I know that she decided to take me on out of friendship for them and I think, regret that she was not there to help when they needed it most.  My parents were well known as heroÕs and adventurers even while they  were shunned for being together and even more after I was born.  They didnÕt care what their families and friends thought, they belonged together and that was that.  The 2 of them together were a sight to see, you could easily visualize their connection.  When father died at the hands of some undead minions, mother knew right away.   He had been guiding a group into a new settlement area that was supposedly safe.  The only reason mother wasn't with him was because she was working closely with a wizard friend on a secret spell against the undead.  Later, after she finished the research she went after his killers.   Although she took down the undead that killed him, she fell into depression and faded away.  There was nothing I could do to help.  I had to watch her slowly die.  I found out later that the research she completed after father died she paid for literally with her soul.  Once her quest for vengeance was over, she had to pay the price.  That is why I know that the undead killed both my parents.  I have hated and hunted them since.  I still don't know exactly what the spell was that she sold her soul for, she  just said that the success would help me and my children against the undead.  Then she named me as the next bearer of the Family Bow of Infinate Arrows.  Only one member from her family attended her funeral and the only reason he came was to pick up the Bow.  He was furious when he found out that she had passed it on to me in front of witnesses even he couldn't discredit.  He never said a word to me just insisted that upon my death the family had the right to the Bow.  I will pass it on to someone who is worthy, for I know that is what she would have wanted.\n",

In May 1918, the anti-Bolshevik Czechoslovak Legion wrested control of parts of Siberia from Bolshevik forces, and the Provisional Siberian Government established itself in Omsk, and Broz and his comrades went into hiding. At this time Broz met a beautiful 14-year-old local girl, Pelagija \"Polka\" Belousova, who hid him then helped him escape to a Kyrgyz village 64 kilometres (40 mi) from Omsk. Broz again worked maintaining the local mill until November 1919 when the Red Army recaptured Omsk from White forces loyal to the Provisional All-Russian Government of Alexander Kolchak. He moved back to Omsk and married Belousova in January 1920. At the time of their marriage, Broz was 27 years old and Belousova was 15. In the autumn of 1920 he and his pregnant wife returned to his homeland, first by train to Narva, by ship to Stettin, then by train to Vienna, where they arrived on 20 September. In early October Broz returned home to Kumrovec in what was then the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes to find that his mother had died and his father had moved to Jastrebarsko near Zagreb. Sources differ over whether Broz joined the Communist Party while in Russia, but he stated that the first time he joined the party was in Zagreb after he returned to his homeland.\n",

She was groomed by the speakers and traders of her band, learning commerce, charm, diplomacy and trickery, and was growing into a most able merchant and intercessor - at least, until her sorcerous powers manifested during her early adulthood, and with them a more monstrous appearance. Within three nights, in the guise of a bad cold, Aletha grew pale and clammy, her dark eyes deepening to whole-black and her teeth sharpening in her mouth into a sharp, sharklike grin.  When the spell passed, she was still recognizeably the woman she was, but grimmer, stranger - and with the ability to call down curses with a power newly awakened in her blood. Ashamed at her transition, Aletha fled the caravan, and now searches the world for a means to reverse her transformation - or, at least, to hide it, and once again resemble the youthful, dark beauty she once was.\n",

He found their skeletons, his wife's ribbone cracked from the attack and blackened with soot. He fashioned a bone flute out of his son's bones and vowed to try and find vengeance on the one who did this. Alton wandered for around 20 years, before running into the Drow Arch Necromancer Cal, who took him in and taught him his ways for 15 years with the promise that Alton could resurrect his loved ones. Cal later threw him out, telling him that he could never be a necromancer. 5 years later, Alton had managed to awaken his latent magical abilities and met up with an adventuring party, who were soon employed by the Stolzkernian royal family to seek a magical amulet which would cure their lands of a 40 year sickness. As they travelled, and his companions discovered what magic he practiced, Alton grew seperate from the group. Eventually, when in an ancient city under the desert sea, Alton discovered a portal to the underdark which, he hypothesized, would give him the material component for the resurrection spell he sought. In order to attain this component, a black diamond, Alton sacrificed his right forearm and a curse was placed on him, with a black corruption slowly consuming him from his stump up. After freeing a Monastary from an invading force, Alton killed two beasts, and for the first time, held onto their souls as the passed through him on their way to the afterlife. These last two events shook Alton and he began to see the darkness he had surrounded himself in. On their way to meet with a Viridian Lady who knew the location of the amulet they sought, Alton ran into a travelling priest of Pelor, Alton's old god, whom he had renounced when his family perished, who told him that he might be able to speak with them through the light of Pelor and, Alton, not yet strong enough to speak with them by necromantic force, began to try this. When they reached this Viridian Lady, she told him of the curse he was under and how he might be able to reverse it--he would need the help of one familiar with the magic of the Underdark, his old mentor Cal.....\n",

He left the Silver Ravens on his own quest of finding answers to his questions, which brought him to Ordulin. It was an unnamed jewel to me and my company since it was pretty much just another job to us. If you don't mind, I think it'd be better and probably easier for integration if you determine the client and destination. I didn't really have anything in mind. The most important part of this was that he was betrayed by his own brother in arms and he has vowed to get revenge.\n",

She had a perfectly normal happy childhood until they had some friends over for dinner, Klaus Reinland and Olaf Mueller. As they made a toast of wine as drank, the Conrads quickly fell asleep. The next night they woke up to firelight, staring at a crowd of cloaked individuals, known as the Order of Judgement. They charged the Conrads of tainting the earth with their foul presence. The punishments would be lashings and death. Bruno and Edmund were the first to be lashed with silver whips. Then it was Klara's turn. She never knew such pain existed, when the pain stopped, and she fell from her restraints. She looked to the parents who saved her before they each took several crossbow bolts to the chest. Suddenly Klara's vision turned red, and then she looked down in horror at the remaining members of the order, clawed to shreds. Knowing that they were no longer safe, she and her brothers went on the run, moving from town to town. Then, one full moon, Klara experienced excruciating pain before blacking out. She and brothers woke up in the woods with torn clothes and bloodstained mouths. Finally they knew, before a couple weeks later, when they befriended a blood hunter named Marwin Wellmark, who told them they had powerful and dangerous blood, and taught them to harness it to protect themselves from the monsters that were hunting them. The last time she saw her brothers, was when they were attacked one day by the Order, and they were forced to go their separate ways.\n",

Scorpio successfully became a lich and Mimi was left alone with the urgent desire to kill Scorpio and destroy his phylactery for the pain and suffering that Scorpio made his family and himself go through. \n",

When war came to Thaver, both Avric and his elder brother Felix joined the army, Avric as a footsoldier, Felix, who was more intellectually gifted, as a Lieutenant. The war lasted for 6 years, and when it was over, Thaver was defeated. There wasn't much glory or use for the defeated soldiers in a lost war, so Avric was left to serve as a day laborer in the town of Parrick. He could not afford a house, so he rented a room in the inn. He was a jovial sort, and managed to brighten the common room with his presence, which the innkeepers appreciated. He wrote to his brother often. After a couple years, however, a new road was made in Thaver, and traders passed less and less through Parrick. With fewer traders, the wages of a laborer grew less and less. He stopped responding to his brother's letters. Eventually, the jobs became scarce and Avric fell unemployed, and soon thereafter, homeless. During a rainstorm, Avric broke into the local temple for shelter and a place to sleep. Come morning, the Priest saw him and took pity on him, and hired him to work around the temple, and offered him lodgings and food. Avric never was much for religion, especially after the war, but the priest's kindness inspired something in him, and he devoted himself to caring for the temple. About a year later, the priest died and a new priest was brought in to shepherd the town. The new priest was not fond of Avric and threw him to the streets. Angry that his devotion was rewarded with such an injustice, Avric once again broke into the temple, and the new priest called the guards on him. He was arrested and sent to the regional prison, where he was cellmates with a halfling Jonn. Avric was a man of great stature, and as such he required more food than the prisoners' allowance. Jonn, as a halfling, did not need as much, and was inclined to share his meals. The two became friends soonafter. Five years into his imprisonment, there was a riot at the prison. Avric decided not to take part in it, but Jonn was killed in the battle. From then on Avric became much more solitary and cut off from the world. At the end of his ten year prison sentence, Avric was a broken man. He had no wealth to his name and a lifetime of weariness. The only thing he was ever any good at, in his mind, was fighting, so he became a mercenary, and traveled through the towns to look for work.\n",

Before he left, however, he took the time to learn all that he could about the natural world - what plants could be eaten, how to track animals, where to find necessities - as he had been fascinated with nature even more than the average wood elf ever since he first saw its raw beauty. Once he felt he had traveled far enough, he made that place his home. He maintained a roof above his head and fashioned a mat for meditation. He used his knowledge of various types of woods to craft a bow to protect himself from predators. Slow to use it, however, he has his fair share of scars, most notably on his chest where he has four parallel scars from where a bear attacked him. After fending off the beast, he ran for shelter lest he encounter more hostile creatures. As he was fleeing, he stumbled upon a pool which was home to a nymph who called herself Maia and, sensing that he cared about nature as much as she did, took him in and cared for him while he healed. He learned much from her about nature along with her language, Sylvan. When he fully recovered, he decided that it was time to leave. As he was alone and received little education, he knew very little about the world outside of nature and had nothing to his name aside from what he made himself. Chimara was happy for nearly 100 years, but slowly he began to yearn for something different. He wanted to do something other than survive. He decided that he wanted to appreciate nature the way it was intended to be enjoyed - with an adventure. He left his home at the age of 125 and headed for civilization. It was there that he first heard about the druids and the power they wield. He sought out a teacher and began to learn the ways of the druids.\n",

Then came the contract when, walking through a doorway like any other, in an inn like any other, he took a spider bite that should have killed him. His fellow adventurers carried him to a monastery, where the monks pretty much brought him back from death's door. They weren't concerned about his past, or his flexible conscience: it was enough, for them, to do whatever they could to revere and preserve life. When Kellett found out how his life had been saved, he made three resolutions: first, that one fifth of all his bounties would be paid over to the monastery; second, that he would only accept contracts that redressed an evil; third, that he would always try first to fulfil his contract without killing, and only kill as a last resort.\n",

Soon less favorable institutions discovered his small size and special ability to communicate telepathically a great benefit.  SweerTar quickly rose through the ranks at a young age as a quite formidable thief and look out.  Until one day the mark was a magical bag found inside a lesser known Druid Guild in Waterdeep.  Although SweerTar procured the bag, he was soon caught of guard. Dumbfounded as how he triggered a spell that made all the house plants grow and grab his body.  Holding him there until the authorities came.  At his trial, which would ultimately lead to death or hard labor, an elder Wood Elf Druid named Rolen, convinced the court of something different.  Rolen would take the young SweerTar and have him work off his punishment in the Druid's Guild.  Thus was his life until he reached adulthood.  Life wasn't all bad though.  SweerTar found himself fully fed, clothed, and educated in a short time.  Simple spells were learned where he could manipulate earth and water, even produce a small flame in his hand to light candles or fires.  The little freedom SweerTar had was dedicated to helping his oldest friends, the animals of the city.  No other before had advocated for the dangerous dog packs, the wretched rat, or the packs of cats in heat.  Rolen enjoyed watching SweerTar engage these animals and with little effort taught the first of his many great spells.  The spell that allowed him to talk to animals.  Not long after SweerTar had the greatest communication network in the city and beyond.  Good and bad stories all around but the need to help those taken advantage of sprung forth.  Thus started SweerTar's quest to not only help the animals of the city but also the injustices caused by a piece of his past, his old Thieve's Guild.\n",

      " In a desolate snowy area of the world, there was little to no magic among the people who lived there, and since it was so rare to see magic, it was seen as a dark power, given to evil souls. Gaia was born into a small village of mixed races of Hunter / gatherers. As a child he used to wander off into the woods singing to himself and playing in the snow. One day when he was walking around he was distracted from his singing from a strange melody coming from behind. Upon futher inspection of the strange noise he found a lyre that was gifted to him from a dieity. Not knowing the magic power he held within, Gaia played this instrument with joy. Though he had never played an instrument before he played this lyre like he had been playing it for years. On his way home he heard whispers coming from the lyre. Telling him he should embrace his magical ability. We wondered too close to the camp site without realizing it and was heard by the villagers. Almost out of nowhere they surrounded him snatching the woode, instrument and putting a bag over his head. As he screamed and cried he felt himself being bonded and hoisted. They removed the bag and he was on a steak. Cry for his life his parents could only turn their head at the sight of their only son being a evil magic user. If only they had known the rest of the world's abilities. As they were about to start the fire a green light shit from the lyre underneath him and tore through the ropes. Gaia fell to the ground but was quickly surrounded again, a burst of loud waves rang out from the lyre knocking everyone unconcious, except him. He picked up the lyre graver as much food and water he could hold and ran off into the woods. He's been on his own ever since. Living off the land and digging alongside his spiritual lyre companion, Ritter.\n",

I woke up in the home of and old Elf woman (visibly old, so she's gotta be like 700) I had never met before.  She said nothing, but made for me a very simple looking soup (if it makes sense, we can say it was in a peculiar glass bowl).  It was, quite simply, the best dish I had ever eaten.  All five flavors worked in perfect harmony along with a 6th, distinct and unidentifiable flavor.  I gulped it down far too quickly, but before I could ask for another bowl, the woman had disappeared.  I stood up to look for her, but still weak and woozy from the beating, I fell back down and lost consciousness.  When I woke up I was at the foot of the restaurant.  I tried to tell the Head Chefs about my experience but they wouldn't believe me.  Since I can't shut up about a thing that I know I'm right about, I kept trying to convince them of what I found.  Eventually they had had enough of it and exiled me, flippantly saying that if I found this so-called 6th flavor and brought it back, they would let me into The Kitchen again.  I know they didn't really mean it, but I'm pretty sure if I actually did find it, then they would be forced to accept me.  This is what has led to my pilgrimage.\n",

His deformities caused the other children to ostracize him, and this extended to his family. After enough bullying, Kai retaliated and killed another child. He was exiled for it, and Soren was left even more lonely, with the hatred of Kai leaking over to his broody younger brother. Soren spent his free time in a nearby forest, just enjoying nature, and trying to befriend some of the animals. At the age of ten, he fell asleep in a tree one day, dreaming of flames emanating from his body, and when he woke up the forest was aflame all around him, with handprints scorched into the wood where his hands were, but he was unburnt; fire danced in his blood, and he felt new channels of a mysterious force opening in his body. Soren had become a monster of some kind. He managed to escape the flames, but had no way to fight the fire, so he ran. His hometown was a logging village, and he had inadvertently ruined a good portion of their livelihood for the season. Knowing that the villagers would not believe that the outcast would not have done this purposely, Soren decided that he would run, and let everyone believe he had died in the blaze. He ran, and made it to the nearest city, where he learned to live on the streets. He found ways to use his new tricks to his advantage, panhandling and performing small tricks for change, stealing when necessary. When he was 17, Soren was finally caught and arrested. Rather than lose his hands, he opted to join the local military for service to work off his debt to society. Soren requested an audience with General LeClezio, showing him his abilities, whereupon he was placed with a group of \"special forces\" who take on specific assignments that the main army is ill-equipped for.

      "The two became fast friends, often venturing out into the streets of New Ark together on adventures. Yuca was QuinoaÕs first kiss - Quin wanted to experience one and felt awful for asking until Yuca assured him it was ok - but nothing ever became of them romantically as they were more inclined to be friends. As his studies became more intense, Quin and Yuca fell out of contact, and he hadnÕt seen him before he ran away upon hearing the news of his father's death.raditional combat training, he enrolled Quin in the cityÕs best clerical seminary. Quinoa didn't have the best relationship with his father, who tended to look down on his sonÕs more scholarly interests, and upon his fatherÕs death, Quinoa ran away from the Keep.  Quinoa's mother was Queen Chia. Chia was kind to Quinoa and was a calming influence in his life. Chia was deeply devoted to Azuth and instilled a love of reading in Quin - she read him some of his first books. She was also a linguist, and maintained that they spoke Elvish in the keep to keep Quinoa attached to his royal heritage. Unfortunately, Chia died when Quinoa was on the cusp of becoming a teen, and was not there to support him through his unsuccessful military and courtly training. Quinoa spent great lengths of time in the KeepÕs extensive library and had read almost all its volumes by the time he came of age. He entered clerical seminary in his late elvish-teens, and only attended for two years before he ran away from New Ark. Due to his protected upbringing, nervous demeanor, and the lack of followers of Azuth at the school (most clerics studying at the seminary followed sun, fire, or water gods), Quin lacked many social skills or commonalities needed to form close bonds with other potential clerics - though he desperately wanted to. Quinoa tried his best, but his tendency to speak at length about his special interests and his penchant for going very quiet and still when he wasn't sure how to proceed in a situation (whether combat-related or societal) tended to alienate him from most of his peers. Quinoa has never really had friends before. He knew many of the Keep staff, but many of his caretakers were much older than him and tended to keep an armÕs length from him in personal matters to remain professional. \n",

Never knowing who his father was, Nirik was trained to use a bow to hunt by his mother. Hunting was a vital part of his villages economy and his mother made a point to let him know that. He trained tirelessly every day. As Nirik came of age his skills in archery were known throughout the North. Providing food for the whole village and taking out any monsters who were causing trouble, Nirik made a name for himself. Eventually, his prowess with a bow provided the opportunity for him to serve as a personal guard for the chief. The highest rank a villager could achieve besides being cheif himself. However, Nirik came from a poor family and the noble villagers felt he had no right to serve the chief so closely. Hatred and jealousy made these naysayers go to Nirik's hut one night. Awakened by the screams of his mother, Nirik saw as these men slit her throat in front of him. Before the intruders could make another move, Nirik slaughtered them where they stood. Anger and the feeling of betrayal caused Nirik to pack all his things that night. After burying his mother, and putting the murderers heads on spikes, Nirik began south and never looked back. \n",

It was literally part of a mountain and the monastery was within the mountain itself.  It reminded me of a dwarven city that I had heard my mother telling stories about.  The monk just walked up to a tree, knocked on it and said,  Ó We of the Brotherhood have passed our test and request entrance the Monastery of Learning.Ó  Then another voice said ÓWhat tests have you passed that has earned your entrance to this holy place?Ó  ÓWe have traveled far and followed the way of our hearts within thru fire, darkness, despair and temptation to come together to this place.Ó said my friend.  ÓIf what you say is true, you will find your own entrance and pass thru w/o harm, if you fail you will never remember this place as only the ones who truly follow the inner path may pass the barrier intact,Ó  the bodiless voice returned.  My friend nodded, took my hand and we walked thru the solid mountain.    ery god that would listen,  for understanding and knowledge and most of all for justice for all of the villagers cut down w/o a chance.   They fed the fires for 2 days, even then I recognized the mark and stench of magical fire.  The only one I saw them carry away was my mother,  they may have taken others as slaves or sacrifices, IÕm not sure.  The feeling of evil radiated off of them like rays from the sun.  They raked threw the ashes to make sure everything was burned.  They were not interested in plunder at all, only utter destruction.  When they left the fires were but smoke and rubble.  There was a pall of despair in their wake.  It seemed like the sun had to filter thru a cover of ugliness even at high noon.  Carrion eaters wouldnÕt even descend, not that there was anything left for them.  Still I prayed.  I could do nothing else.  I guess I received an answer as I knew that if I betrayed my presence to them it would all have been in vain.  So I waited and watched.  2 days after the village was burned a small party of clerics that had dark robes came by.  They appeared to be looking for something.  I sincerely hoped they wouldnÕt find me.  While they were there it seemed as if the cloud thickened and grew more evil.  They searched all day and night.  As dawn approached they finally passed on.   3 days after the clerics left I felt a change.  I could actually feel the sun again, and see the gloom lifting.  A man walked to where I was hiding and he seemed to know I was there.  He just stood nearby and said. ÓThere will come a day when you know that you must trust your heart as your mother told you, is today that day?Ó  Then he stood there and waited, I somehow knew he could wait forever w/o any problems.  I listened to my heart that day when I came out of my hiding place and began to follow the monk.\n",

Normally, the adherents of Pelor are pacifists, but the temple was under pressure from local organized crime. Horus, along with some of the other 'saved' fighters in the temple fought back, where his new-found faith was key to winning the skirmish. Thereafter, Horus was trained in the prayers and battle-doctrine of the niche sub-sect of the Pelorian Guard. Clad in gleaming plate and tower shield (normal-sized shield to a human-sized creature), now Horus travels from town to town proselytizing and offering aid to the underclasses and those who cannot defend themselves.

      "Forgoing the traditional method of fighting unarmed as the Chosen Evelith had, Elise trained with an elite group of blunt weapon wielding warriors under LÕericÕs guidance.  Known as the ÒPainbearers of the Pure,Ó they act as the fighting arm of the church of the White Gardenia, going on covert missions to punish those who harm others.  After four years of intense instruction, Elise was given her first assignment.  Instead of being tasked to secretly eliminate a tyrannical leader, she was instead to search for any information or evidence regarding the disappearance of Evelith, who had gone missing a year before. White Gardenia has a history of accepting orphaned children into their fold, so their subsequent adoption of Elise was not considered unusual.  It was then that EliseÕs real training began.\n",

      "-I was approached and told to go to the inn for another briefing.  They said it would definately be profitable though.  This contact came straight to me and not thru my old friends.  I guess I'm getting a reputation on my own now.  Interesting what some profitable working can do.  I went, and was told the price is 2,000 gp up front and 8,000 gp ea when we are done.  It sounds like it would be fun anyway as it involves planeshifting.  Something I've only done when I got here.  Did I mention the weird group is hired as well?  We are all going to Kalamar, to a city called Thycasha.  There is a sage there we have to go see.  Apparently, some archeologist known as Mad Raddock borrowed 100,000 gp and started giving it away to everyone but the owners.  He was trying to find the \"Orb of Midnight\".  According to the sage, there are actually 2 pieces that make up the Orb.  The local Temple of Nightmares or something like that is after it as well.  Their symbol is a full moon w/an open eye in it.  I will definately keep my eyes open for the symbol and stay away from the anyone who has anything to do with it.  If we are indeed after the same thing  they are probably more than willing to slit the throat  of anyone who gets in there way.  Holy Fanactics, there is no one crazier in all the planes.  The sage said he could draw us a map and we agreed to wait the 2 days and pay the 500 gp for a very fine, very detailed map.  I will try to get ahold of it before all things are said and done.  Unfortuneately the other halfling is the groups map carrier.  That  will work as long as I get it when we are done.  While we were waiting on the map, we decided to check out the town and see what was to be had.  I found a Ring of Protection +1, that I decided to splurge on.  The Royal Pretender placed a 800 gp price on the head of one the mage's familiar.  It was tempting but I know better than to fuck w/ a mage's familiar.  Someone else didn't know better and killed it with several ice blasts.  I looked around but nothing else caught my fancy.  A really stupid thief tried to make off w/ my belt pouch but he was very unlucky.  I grabbed his wrist and asked him \"Don't you know better then to try that on someone else in the trade?\" He just kinda panicked and said \"Let me go!\"  I told him I would as soon as he removed his hand from my pouch.  He dropped my pouch like a hot potatoe and took off like the hounds of hell were after him.  If he is an example of the local talent, I'm not to impressed.  Although from the looks of things with the amount of guards all over you gotta give him credit for trying.  Any way the next 2 days were fairly uneventful.  The mage is mad and the Royal Pretender is carrying around the iceball remains of familiar it cost him 800 gp to have killed.  The other halfling was forced to find stabling for his mount as there is no way the beast can take the heat of the desert.  To bad, it seemed like a nice St. Bernard.  I believe that everyone in the group but me is dead broke now.  Some items that looked interesting but I couldn't afford were, Flask of Endless H20 (5,000 gp) ring of protection against the elements +5 (1,500 gp).  Maybe when we get back I'll pick them up.  I'm trying to decide what else would be useful besides a bag of holding 5,000 ilbs.  I think I may try to find one of those stone mounts that go back and forth from stone to flesh.  Maybe a bear or a cat of some kind.  I know that my dreams are becoming very interesting.  They are featuring me casually flinging magic about like a sorceror, sometimes I even have a ethereal type monkey on my shoulder.  Other times I'm actually holding a conversation with the monkey.  I'm not sure why I've been dreaming these but they seem unusual to say the least.  I'll have to talk to the spellcasters and see if I can figure out where they are coming from. They may just be part of this place, but they seem almost familiar, as if I've dreamed them before and just not remembered the dreams when I woke up.  We finally got the map from the sage and set out immediately.  At the end of the first day we voted to travel at night instead of daylight though.  This is my first experience with the desert.  I would much rather sleep thru the heat of the day whenever possible.  We came across a strange person, almost naked who apparently lived off the blood of vultures.  Better vultures than halflings, but he was still pretty weird.  I kept my distance, and was releived to leave him behind as we continued our trip.  At the rate we are traveling it will take a total of 7 days to reach our destination.  At least we don't have to cross the hills as well.  We've been staying the night in some sort of magical fort that protects from the elements put up by the mage that lost his familiar.  He seems a fairly good sport about it so far though.  I don't think I would be in his shoes but to each his own.  We came across some people looking for lost mines and found out that there are actually quite a few people populating the desert.  Several groups/singles have passed by with the moon/eye symbol as well.  I am definately still keeping and eye out for them.  We have only had 3 instances where we were troubled by creatures out to do us harm.  In all 3 cases the monsters were stopped w/o my direct help.  I must admit I'm pleased with the groups determination to totally annihalate anything in their way.  The one arrow that I managed to get off completely missed the Manticore.  The rest were dead by the time I loaded my cross-bow.  That makes me feel better for their survival when we get to the pyramid we are looking for.  We came across the Pyramid at the end of the 7th night.  We did a basic look around but decided to enter tomorrow when the whole group was fresh.  I can't wait until then as then we will be in my element.  I'm getting a good night's sleep as tomorrow the real fun begins.  I hope we find a bunch of gems and stuff.  Wouldn't it be cool if we found some enspelled gems as well.  They would be worth a bundle to the right market.  Most of the time people don't even think of it though.  \n",

I began a lucrative career as a burglar, starting with small residential homes and moving up to banks and jewelry stores. ItÕs been 15 years, and while IÕm not quite a local legend, other criminals definitely know about me. IÕm known only as Fin, and I donÕt address my elf heritage at all, ever, with anyone. I have a solid network of contacts among other thieves, fences, smugglers, and the occasional assassin. I rarely work on contract, stealing only for myself. I use as little magic as possible, though I sometimes canÕt help it. When IÕm in danger, my hands itch, and I have about five minutes to figure it out myself, practically or magically, or it just bursts out of me in whatever form seems helpful. (ItÕs not always that helpful.) Lately, now that IÕm reaching full adulthood, IÕve started to regret not being able to make friends. IÕve been in the same place for a long time now, and I have connections, but I consider no one a friend. None of my liasons have ever had a romantic component. IÕve begun to feel lonely. So when a cleric approached me and asked to enlist my skills in stealing a religious amulet, I thought that maybe that could be the key to getting back what the demon took from me. A favor from a goddess would trump a demon, right? So I agreed, violating my usual no-contract rule, and set out with the cleric. nt of scratching helped, and by the time my palms were raw and bleeding, it crescendoed to a powerful buzz that was, finally, not painful but all-consuming. Lightning struck our house. Fires sprung up in places that the lightning hadnÕt struck, and somehow the surrounding rain refused to touch it. The itching subsided. I didnÕt know what part of that was my doing, but I knew I was responsible. And now more than ever, I didnÕt care if anyone in the house lived or died, so I took my things and left. \n",

He has recently lost a finger, gotten a part-time job at a coffee house, and discovered the joys of the opium den. Civilization may not be the best place for Argus, but he's finding himself. He remains extremely good at killing.\n",

      " Clavis Roaringrim is an Illusionist Mage from a long line of Tiefling arcanists living in Sigil. His father, a high ranked Artificer felt his son needed to have some real world experience, and had him forcibly taken to the Forgotten Realms and left to his own devices. Clavis is a shameless flirt, and proud of his abilities to charm, trick, and lie his way out of any situation. His skills in the arcane arts are well developed if poorly utilized. Growing up in Sigil, he became familiar with many planes and their denizens, which sometimes get mixed up in his mind, causing some confusion to others in his mannerisms and sense of history. He is easily recognizable for the feathered wide brimmed hat he wears between his horns, and the matching purple tinted tunic and cape he wears, along with a distinctive staff bearing the mark of his house. His tiefling blood has left him with slightly red skin, a pair of wide re-curved horns swept back from his temples, and a fork-tipped tail he keeps hidden under his elaborate cloak. His infernal rage is normally kept in check, but when he becomes frustrated or disgruntled, he tends to lash out with the little pyromancy he knows. Clavis has spent several years roaming the Realms, and recently has taken up with a small band of adventurers for want of anything more engaging to fill his time. \n",

      " Standin was a young gnome of 17 years when he began his apprenticeship with master Janata. Over the course of 12 years of study and training, Standin learned the ways of magic. From simple spells that would clean his master's home in an instant, to complex battle magicks that would reduce his foes to a pile of ashen waste. Standin was a quick study, and was praised by master Janata for his astounding ability to learn spells almost faster than his master could teach them. But casting spells was not the only thing Standin had been taught. He had been trained in the dangerous art of quick casting spells, firing off his spells in rapid succession. Having also been tough to use his small stature, agility and surprising speed to his advantage in avoiding opponents, he was quite a force to be reckoned with, if not a small one. Standin joined a small adventuring party some years after his training had been completed, and made some extraordinary discoveries whilst in there company. His greatest discovery, and most prized possession, was an ancient tome describing a long forgotten form of dwarven metal magic! Standin worked night and day to decipher the ancient language of the dwarves, to learn their spells, and to become a master of the five elemental magicks... and still does.\n",

      " Gildarts grew up in a small, insignificant village. His sense of humor was always strange, to the point where he taught a kobold to speak common as a joke. His humor took a stranger, darker turn, however, when the dying started. One by one, his family died bloody, pointless deaths, and there was nothing Gildarts could do. Nothing, that is, except laugh. And so he did. He laughed when his mother died, because it was either that or collapse under the weight of his pain. He travels the world as a comedian now, his jokes carrying a strange power to them, with his favorite application being to make people or monsters kill each other. He thinks it's hilarious, and is often confused when others disagree. There's a darkness in Gildarts, and every now and then, when somebody ruins his fun or forces him to confront his pain, it emerges, and that's when he really starts to laugh.\n",

They arrived in the small town and found a healer to attend to Horkas, Vic had visited towns before but never for an extended period, as every hour passed his restlessness grew. The healer informed Vic that his dwarven friend needed to rest and guided them to an inn. Horkas gave Vic a small coin purse to pay for the room and food, as Vic awkwardly talked to the barkeep about the absurdity of paying to sleep somewhere he slammed down 5 gold pieces and said this better be worth it. Because the room only cost 2 gold and the barkeep was somewhat frightened by the wild looking half-elf, he yelled for a waitress to bring food and he poured a large mug of beer. Vic had never tasted anything more delicious and as he finished the second mug he was feeling much less restless. Horkas took two days to recover and Vic spent most of it in various states of intoxication. Horkas had a short list of other dangerous beasts in the area and suggested that Vic aid him in dispatching them. They traveled together for six years hunting dangerous beasts until Horkas received a message calling him back to his home in the mountains. Vic had spent more and more time away from the tribe and when he made his way to the spring hunting grounds only a few families remained. The chief had died and his successor was mostly incompetent and somewhat lazy, he took his family and settled in a small city. After that many other groups went north to find more remote wilderness and better hunting. Vic took to the coastal road, guiding travelers for a few coins and then spending it all drinking when in a town or city. A few years go by and he made his way north passed Waterdeep and on to Neverwinter, he has heard talk of forest land being sold in large parcels and wishes to make some serious coin.

His father clung to power, but his uncles and other usurpers were all vying to control the kingdom. Along with his northern schooling, Sevash had been well-trained in combat by his father, using the ehl-herkar style of fighting, in which one gives in to the rage of battle, harnessing it to achieve great physical feats. Sevash excelled in this style of combat, yet he considered himself above it by virtue of his schooling. He wanted to bring the kingdom into a more sophisticated future, leaving what he saw as primitive tribal ways behind. When he did let the rage sweep over him, afterward he carefully combed his white hair and stitched any rends in his fine garments, seeming embarrassed by his own barbaric nature. He is constantly in conflict between his warrior heritage and his educated side, and has not yet figured out how to integrate the two halves of his life.\n",

She learned to control her inner chaos, after years of self-punishment and scarification (which she inflicted upon herself). Her \"Black blood\" as her tutor called her lineage. was also a source of power which she, with the help of her tutor, learned to channel into furious dark and destructive magic. Later on when Idun the felt there was no more to learn from her tutor she killed him in a dark ritual which honed her demonic powers even further. Her powers comes partly from af demonic pact. The demon of question, 'Ashkantosh' was humiliated several times by the Goddess Shar. 'Ashkantosh' found a way to create flames that tap the shadow weave, and hereby lessening Shar's power. This way Idun is able to conjure flames that cannot be put out by normal means. It consumes everything, even magical fire. And hereby it's able to damage creature, normally immune to fire damage (dealing half damage). The only thing that the flames can't consume is Idun herself, demons superior to 'Ashkantosh' and dieties.\n",

Unfortunately, having a love for breaking things resulted in awfully destructive behaviours, especially when drunk. This lead to Kava being exiled from her town and family and, to this day, she doesn't know if her parents are alive or not. Whilst wandering in the wilderness drunk and alone she found a group of adventures who were, at first, worried at the sight of such a rare being, then accepted her into their group. After several years of travelling with this group, on the eve of their 10th year together, she suddenly realised she hadn't touched a drop of alcohol since she joined them. When she mentioned this, and that she wanted to know why she had started drinking, to the wizard who had sent them on so many journeys as a group, he sent her to see a friend of his who could allow her to uncover any lost memories. It was only at this time Kava uncovered that, while training to be a Soldier, she had not only been abused verbally and physically as part of her training, but sexually, by almost all the Officers training her. Kava had always known her promotion to Officer had come as a surprise at the time. The wizard's friend also helped her uncover short flashes of memories of torturing and murdering the Officers who had abused her. It was hard to tell if she had done this over some time or in one mad night. After these revelations, she remained tight lipped on the subject for several more years, never allowing any of her adventurer's group to know anything of her sessions with the wizard's friend. To this day, Kava has only absent mindedly uttered 3 intelligible words on the subject when asked why she went to see this man - \"Past. Memories. Future.\"\n",

That point onward, they took the ship known as \"The Sad Devil of the North\", and these men were pirates. Some time later, after enjoying their newfound freedom, the men were in port at a town known by Novinia. That is were Leucis met his newfound love, a human noble named Violette. Before setting out again, Leucis promised Violette untold riches and treasure when he returned from sea. However, the minotaur thought otherwise. The minotaur, known to some as Caesar, hated being under the leadership of Leucis and his quartermaster Tharrakir, who was but a boy. That trip saw Caesar staging a mutiny to kill both of the tieflings. Thrown overboard and cast away, the two fell-born men found them selves adrift in the eastern coast of Akenmir. With no knowledge of where their ship was, or where Violette was, Leucis used his natural knowledge of the land and Tharrakir's talent for magic to make way as mercenaries. Becoming known as \"The Salted Devil\" or \"The Cast-Away Ranger\", Leucis now finds himself traveling in caravans with Tharrakir, a human woman named Nova, a halforc mercenary named Aleksi, and a younger halforc named Henk.\n",

When Victor was again aware of his surroundings, the master was gone. The room was empty. Victor hesitantly stood, testing the leather, wood, and steel that now made up most of his body. He walked through an archway into the room beyond, and found a low bench with clothing and a pack on it, as well as weapons. To the side was a mirror that reached floor to ceiling. Victor stared. He saw a naked man, short and slim, with skin the color of well worn leather or waxed mahogany. A seam ran down his chest, starting at the base of his throat and ending at his navel, and inside he saw gears, shafts, dials, and wires. In the center of his chest, nestled among the machinery, glowed a red crystal shaped like a heart, with perfectly chiseled chambers and valves.

Then the new piece was attached. Piece by piece, the subject was disassembled and remade, aware the whole time. There are no words in any language, save perhaps infernal, to describe the pain. He begged every day, or at least every day that he had a mouth to beg, for the torment to end. The master was cold and unyielding in his amoral scientific fervor, but the other students left, one by one, and never returned. The doctor was left alone with his creation. Towards the end of the process, one other person did appear. The haze of pain masked their appearance and their words to the subject, but their purpose would become clear in hindsight. In fact, it would become nearly all-consuming. On the final day, the subject's pain faded, leaving him clear-headed and... Whole.

Houjin recognised hers as a mind with the  potential for nearly limitless growth, so she was taken on as a student. Oona quickly mastered not only the exercises but the draconic language itself. But as Oona grew, she began to feel restless. She had a longing, although she was unable to identify what for and she started to question whether or not Houjin truly knew all the answers to the questions of life. When Oona achieved the status of Master, she cared more for the autonomy of the position than the honour. With her newly gained access, he spent many a day alone, exploring the deepest and dustiest cavities in the sanctuaries, slowly piecing together clues that illuminated the forbidden past. Her peer yet competitor, Yashin, warned her of the danger in seeking out knowledge without the dragonlord's permission, but Oona saw no harm in research; besides, something has never felt right in the histories. She discovered the truth of Faerun's past; it was not always a world ruled and feared by dragons as the teachings of Houjin claimed. At one time, humanoid 'Khans' led mighty clans that dominated the land unopposed. Oona also learned legend of a powerful spirit dragon, Tatsuo, from whom all dragons were formed. She felt drawn to find Tatsuo, believing he could quench her longing for clarity. Eventually she was discovered, confronted and ousted by Yashin, who had hoped to use her downfall to further his own stature. Oona managed to overpower and disfigure him then made her escape but was labeled as a heretic to be killed on sight. So, she then set out into Faerun as a Chronicler on a sojourn of discovery.\n",

Since that day, Beau has been on his own, working as a musician to raise funds and training and making alliances to raise an army so he can return and kill the evil king.  He has no idea whether or not his family is alive, but he feels like he must get vengeance for the abuse they all suffered even if saving his family is not possible.\n",

The chief of her tribe,her father, married a Frentini female the council of elders considered sickly and weak and only bore him two daughters. He didn't mind ,he loved her and was a very liberal against the grain kind of chief. As he raised his eldest daughter, Ursa  he allowed her to choose her own path in life and it turned out she was great at fighting. She was the best warrior in her village , and her father promised her she could be the next chief, despite tradition. He died suddenly and Ursa was set to be the next chief but her aunt who was on the council decided to rally against her in order to get her own son made chief. Despite the fact he was practically the drooling kind of stupid and much less qualified in combat . Regardless the Frentini are rooted in tradition and even though Ursa was appreciated for her skills throughout the village they decided to go with a male heir. Ursa was enraged by this and left her home. She loved her family but -from her perspective -  they did nothing to prevent her cousin's undeserving rise to power. She left for a land where she heard anyone could be anything . There she fell on hard times, looking for work with no luck,  living in the slums of the city reserved for fellow animorphs. One day she accidently ended up in a bar on slam poetry night. Many feminists and other minority groups were speaking about the discrimination they faced simply because of features they inherited from birth.  Ursa understood this struggle.  Their passion to change the world they are in reignited her own and she became an avid supporter of civil rights for all impressed peoples. A few days later she found a team looking for fighters and joined them. They dubbed themselves Tactical Grace and set off. Now she gets to do what she loves and fight and spread the word of justice and equality for all.  So,yeah she's basically a giant bear that goes around and will punch you out while also renlentlessly telling you about the struggles facing minority groups in that world. \n",

During this time she became skilled in the art of entertainment (singing, fire-eating and juggling being her main acts) and their joint act (called The Wailing Sirens) never failed to impress their audience. However, her father grew old and weary of their travels and was forced to retire to a farm in Red Larch. With her solo act she struggled to make ends meet. Then one night, after a performance, she was approached by a dwarf called Brolin and ask to join him and his gang of seemingly shady individuals at their table. After watching her perform, they figured her skills would come in handy for their gang, known as the hand of Yartar. All through the night they shared stories of their mischievous deeds and all of the coin that they had made. And after a full night of drinking together, she decided to join them. After a couple of years, she built up quite an impressive reputation in the guild with her excellent thievery skills. Then one day, she was sent on an important mission to collect a great treasure, the mummified hand of a renowned saint. However, before they were able to deliver the treasure, Brolin mysteriously disappeared with the item still in his possession. Returning alone and empty-handed was not received well by the thieves' guild to say the least. However, instead of killing her, they decided to exile her instead. Following her exile she returned back to her father's farm in Red Larch. There her father told her about the rumours heard around the area about some dark and mysterious happenings.

Finn's father tasked the group with investigating a circus in town which was in question of being a group of cultist but before they left the church was attacked by hell hounds. After the party defeated the hell hounds they promised that they will bring light to whatever the circus may be hiding. On the way out Finn decided to join the group in investigating the circus and they went on there marry way. Later after they investigated and got the circuses side of the story(they told the party that their crusaders trying to stop an evil religion) and Finn didn't believe them until a spy was caught and before he could be question he did a certain spell which when casted showed a red star. Later they then discussed what to do, they could either report back to the church and question Joseph about the spy or defeat the circus people who claim were crusaders but a certain sacrifice room points otherwise. In the end the group decided to confront Joseph on the spy, Finn wanted to follow his fathers wishes but he was also shaken by the spy and what happened to him. When they arrived at the church immediately the group started bombarding Joseph with question but Joseph said that he cannot elaborate on the spy nor did he wanted to talk about anything that may point that the church is evil. Finn fed up of all the arguing started questioning his father and started to scream at him, in the end it ended with Finn denouncing the religion he believed for so long. This broke Joseph heart, Joseph was now enraged and blamed the group for tainting his sons mind and branded them traitors for betraying his trust. Then one member attacked the Joseph, Finn and Joseph were shocked and then Joseph got mad. he pushed back his attack and said \"That's it you betray my trust, you turn my son against me, and now you attack me in this holy place! May your gods give you mercy in hell.\" With that he grab a sheathed katana with sealing charms on it and before he sheathed it he looked at his son and said \"I'm sorry\" he then unsheathed the sword and with that his and Finn's form change. In mere moments Finn the normal book worm who wanted to explore the world and Joseph a loving father who cared about his son more than his church become huge powerful Oni's. Finn now looking at his new form went into catatonic shock and before he could react his father held up his hand and said \"sleep\" then Finn passed out. Next thing he knew when he awoke it looked like he was in hell, all of the monks were dead the walls and floor we cracked and bloody, and then Finn saw it, his father dead with his own sword stab through is own heart with the one who attack his father pulling the sword out of his fathers dead body. Finn went to his knees he couldn't process this, his father, his home, his friends, his form....gone. All because he brought these adventures here. Before the group left they took his fathers other weapon the  kanab_  and dropped his fathers sword in front of him with the blood still on the blade. 2 days, Finn finally got out of that shock after two days, still in the wreckage of his home he found the scabbard for the sword and sheathed it and surprisingly he return to his original form. \"The sword itself is connected to me\" he thought \"when I sheathe the blade my true power in unleashed\" he then scowled \"I swear I will defeat the ones who took everything from me with this blade sheathed, with this form, MY FORM and If I cant defeat them only then will I use my full power so that if I may die at least I'll take out all of them and I'll be able to see my father again.\" and with that vow he collect the rest of his stuff, buried his father and went out into the world to train and to get revenge on the ones who destroyed his way of life.       \n",

Merlin showed Gnosi that knowledge is not bad and that it can be used to better yourself. Many years had passed and a burning question had stuck with Gnosi his whole life, ÒWhy did the ashen tree pick me?Ó Merlin knew the answer but did not want to tell him until he was ready to know.

Once, however, when he was driven off by a particularly savage beating, he stumbled upon an entrance down into Khyber, and within, the ruins of an old, militant monastery. Skurrg learned from the writings down there, mastering its powerful blade techniques--and as he stayed there, the strange influences of Khyber warped him slightly, growing to a monstrous size in excess of 8 feet tall. His skill and size earned him notice, and he was soon sent to Sharn by the Daughters of Sora Kell, to aid the criminal organization Daask. While he was a feared enforcer, Skurrg also led something of a double life, enjoying the finest restaurants and art galleries, and operas that Sharn had to offer, in no small part because his mere presence ruined it for everyone else there. Eventually, he was instructed to work with House Tarkanen, another criminal organization, to retrieve some members returning from an accidental trip to Xoriat, and that's where his adventure truly begins.\n",

He got himself a job as Ensign on the \"Seraph's Grace\", the ship in charge of taking Lord Arai on a tour around the Kirisu islands. When the ship was attacked, he decided to save Lord Arai to gain his trust and it was then that he met the rest of his fellow adventurers.\n",

It is in this town that Trar Dewstream was born and raised. Born to human parents, he learned from his druid father to respect nature, care for animals, and how to earn a living as a guide to those looking for passage through the mountains. Not one to care too much for the city dwellers in the valley below, he spent most of his years communing with nature and learning the ways of the wild. That is until his 26th year. A Peryton came down from the mountains and kidnapped Trar's parents while he was in the settlement of Glasspring after just finishing guiding a group down from the mountains. Returning to his village and hearing of the deaths by the beast, Trar left on a quest for revenge. It took a year of mapping the mountains and tracking down rumors to discover the creatures lair. Roosting high in a hidden mountain forest, a mating pair and their two offspring had made a nest. Here, Trar found the remains of his parents. Flying into a rage, he killed the foul beasts without mercy. Taking a trophy from the creature, a stag horn from the head of the beast, he set up a home in the forest to mourn the loss of his parents and commune with nature. Here he had his first vision of the disaster that was coming. For three years he prepared, honing his druid abilities, haunted nightly by the visions of the cataclysm. Until another vision came. A vision that took him down from the mountains to the outskirts of the great city of Waterford.\n",

The people of the main Kingdom would torment him for their wishes to be answered, so Aukitza decided to leave to have some peace in their lives. He found a travelling group of nomads that consisted of Clerics and Druids trying to cope with poverty in the harsh deserts to the west. There, they flourished. Rose became a priestess and Aukitza helped raise new temples and barns. Eventually they had another child, Aquis. Aquis, like her brother Dinnis, was a Water Genasi. The two of them could create clean water to fill the reservoirs for the clergymen and poor of the temples. One fateful night, upon arriving home, Rose walked into an ambush that had been set up by a corrupt group of men from the main Kingdom. They demanded that Aukitza grant them a wish, or they would kill him. Aukitza, while inherently magical, actually had no ability to cast a wish. Then, one of the guards killed Dinnis, who was only 7. Aquis watched in horror as her mother and father were helpless to meet the demands of these warriors. They then threatened to take Roses life. Aukitza looked into Aquis' eyes, and with his last words said \"I'm sorry\", as he charged forward attempting to grab his scimitar off the wall, when Rose was struck down. As the guards went to apprehend Aukitza, one of the guards made what appeared to be a killing strike on him and he burst into smoke. The guards started shouting at each other, thinking they could maybe take his daughter for ransom, but ultimately decided to leave because there was nothing more they could do without the Genie who was dead. So they left. Aquis cried until the morning clutching her dead mother, where she ran out of energy to carry on. The tribesmen found her and decided to bury Rose and Dinnis and hold a funeral that night. Aquis remained with the small group of nomads which formed into a small town of 1,000. While she mostly worked in the temple, she was always interested in the druids of their settlement, and noticed that one of them was a survivalist trainer. After filling the water reservoirs in the church, she would go train with the druids, eventually learning interesting magic from them. She vows to get revenge on the band of warriors that slayed her family in front of her, and wields her father's scimitar in the hopes that she crosses their paths.

As a starry-eyed, sharp-toothed youngster, I turned up to the office, where they turned me down. So I turned to the next best thing, a mercenary crew defending merchant ships from pirates. They were wary of me at first, but on a ship, everyone pulls their weight, and we got along fine. Not much happened, since the pirates went after the merchants who didn't hire armed escorts. The lingering smell of alcohol on my breath earned me the name \"Boozebreath\". So they tried to get me drunk. After a barrel or two to overcome my resistance to poison, I was properly drunk. And then I took a dare to walk off the plank. Again, I was 15. To add to my misfortunes, I scraped myself against a railing. The blood spread through the waters, drawing the attention of a nearby shark. Drunk and foolhardy, I stared it down as it approached, and punched it across the face. As the shark began to bleed, I began to get angrier. And that was the first time I flew into a rage, tearing the shark's teeth and fins out. I returned to the ship, corpse over my shoulder, and got even more drunk. I spent another few years on the ship, keeping my shark souvenirs close at hand. 8 years after, the pirates finally grew bold enough to attack the ship I was on, in the middle of the night. They fought their way onto the ship, taking it over and slaughtering our crew. They kept me alive, bound and restrained, uncertain how to kill me as I frothed and shrugged off blows from their blades. When they left me alone, I melted the restraints with my spit, both the ropes and the guards. And then, with my axe, a piece of flint, and a pile of gunpowder, I brought the ship down with us.\n",

When she woke up several hours later, bleeding and with many broken bones in the forest, she had no idea where she was. During the several weeks she lay there healing, she got to know the animals who lived in the forest, especially the baby bear who came by to lick her wounds. She also had many strange dreams about a goat faced god watching her. Eventually, she came to care for the animals she used to hunt and renounced her old ways to live in the forest. For several years, she and the bear (who she named Huggins) lived and hunted together, roaming through the woods living in harmony with nature. However, half elves live much longer than bears. The night after Huggins died, Ennis had another dream about the goat faced god. When she woke up, she found herself many miles away, among the followers of the goat faced god, who they called Pickles. Pickles was a god of nature, and when he deemed his followers were trained enough in the druidic arts, he sent them to the part of the forest that was in most need of healing. After several years with the Followers of Pickles, Ennis woke up in a strange part of the forest. Few animals lived there due to overhunting, and she used her skills to protect the animals that remained, by hiding them and scaring off poachers with her magic. Eventually, the legend in the local village grew that there was a witch who punished anyone who hurt her forest, and the overhunting stopped. Ennis still doesn't know exactly where she is, or if her work is done yet, so she stays close to the village to keep an eye on hunting parties and every once in a while, she sneaks into the village for a cheese platter. \n",

Many there do not worship and are prone to logic based thinking, but there is still a strong religious secret within the People of the Sand. As an apprentice, Niershka began to study mechanical contraptions. She soon became adept in tinkering, fixing, and inventing. Once her mentor passed, she took over his shop and has expanded the business. While her shop in the desert is her main business, she also occasionally opens pop ups with mechanical wonders. Despite her mentor's good heart and kindness for others, Niershka does not harbor said trait. She explores the world soley to make a profit and lies and steals her way to fame. What's important to her is to make a name for herself and gather riches to strengthen her shop and mechanical research. She is manipulative and sneaks her way through situation. No one ever expects such trickey from a small halfling female, and she's full aware of that. She is not wicked, but rather very selfish and focused on what's good for her. Despite her small mindedness, she is loved by the people of the Sand, and is considered one of the prices of their community, with many lining up long before her doors open to see what fantastic, new mechanical wonder she has in store for them next.\n",

Kamali and Modoc stood further away slinging spells at the beast. With a simple gesture from the Oni the entire chamber became freezing winds and driving snow, obscuring the party's vision. Before they could react the demon teleported between the two spell casters. Bringing down it's massive clawed hand down upon Modoc and with a single mighty blow sent the wizard flying across the room. Modoc's broken body slammed into the wall and fell to the floor. When the mage gathered enough strength to stand up and the stars cleared from his eyes he saw the Oni's claw clutching tightly KamaliÕs lifeless body by the throat. Gorignak rushed frantically to cut down the fiend that had slain their friend. The barbarianÕs progress was slowed by the freezing gales, but upon reaching the beast he landed many savage blows, splattering it's black blood throughout the room. A few meters away to ModocÕs right, James kneeled to steady himself as he fired arrow after arrow into the fray. Then, to the wizard's horror, he witnessed to fell creatureÕs clawed hand reach into GorignakÕs chest. And then retract with the barbarianÕs in its grasp. The goliath managed to shrug off the wound just long enough to land one final blow before falling, almost cleaving the OniÕs head form it's body. With it's black blood spewing from many savage wounds the demon summoned it's dying strength.

      " Abandoned by her elven mother as a child, the young half-orc was perhaps fortunate to be discovered and taken in by a roaming pack of orcs. They gave her a home, something like a family, and a name. Gnat. She soon learned that disdain for her elven heritage would never be far away. Gnat worked hard to ensure she could keep up with her peers and deserve her place among the warriors, but she always had interests that lay beyond those of the pack. During raids, she would often find books and spend hours delving into them. Then one day, while ransacking a wizard's home, she found herself blown away by the contents of the books she found there. Literally. In awe of the power contained in those words, she took it as a sign to finally part ways with a tribe that had only ever tolerated her, and ÒconvincedÓ the wizard to take her on as a student. She stayed with him over a year, but eventually grew bored with his lethargic way of life and frustrated by her own lack of progress with magic. Grabbing her notes and ripping a few pages out of her favorite tomes, she took off, seeking adventure and magic elsewhere.\n",

Now you might expect that this is where Sora would start her adventure, but in fact it was not, for Sora was very much used to working in the tavern and didn't wish for much more in life. The night after the revolt Sora was visited by her ancient ancestors, great dragons of the past who told her of her heritage and her destiny.

      " NÕtalhi came into her power very simply. Her family had been protectors of a death god referred to as the Unknown for generations. She was expected to continue this family journey as well. Spreading the word of the Unknown, and living by itÕs rules. As the second child in her family, her brother was to take his place as the head of the temple once their mother chose to step down, while NÕtalhi was allowed to travel more freely. The local lord of their city, Lord Cavannaugh, was a very religious man and encouraged his family to regularly attend worship on the holy days of the Unknown. His youngest daughter, Kalina, was often in attendance. Kalina and NÕtalhi soon became fast friends, and then infatuated with each other. Together they schemed up a political pact that would ensure they could live together without any Òfamily dutiesÓ preventing them from being together. They proposed a Òpolitical marriageÓ that really had little to do with politics and more to do with love. Their parents allowed this, and chose to view it as a political union between the heads of state and the head of religion in their region. One day, Kalina had been acting strangely, and had stopped attending worship at the temple of the Unknown. After about a week NÕtalhi, being of a stubborn sort, tracked her down and realized that not all was what it seemed. Through her connection with the unknown it became clear that Kalina had been killed, her corpse reanimated, and was being used by mecromancers to disrupt the political situation. In tears she struck down the creature that was once her fiance, and carefully brought her body to the temple. Once the body had been slain a second time, it became clear that she had been dead for quite some time. NÕtalhi took it as a personal failure that she and her temple had not been able to notice the infiltration of the undead in their home. She was heartbroken and furious. She offered up a deal to the Unknown- eradicate the sect of mecromancers spitting in the face of their religion, and she would be granted her love back. Whole and unharmed. The Unknown accepted, and NÕtalhi now roams throughout the world, searching for whispers of the black sect, and making sure that no others fall to the same fate as she. Now all she needs is a group of friends to help her carve out the undead.\n",

He never knew his mother, but he knew that she was a part of an evil cult. He had four siblings. 2 sisters and 2 brothers. His older sister always despised him, and most siblings do, but this hate ran deeper. She blamed ThuÕrum for all the misfortunes the family had. ThuÕrum accepted this, but it hardened him. He loved his siblings, but when his younger sister was murdered by one of ThuÕrumÕs rivals at his school, he had enough. He beat the boy within an inch of his life. The guards hauled him away, and threw him in jail for 6 years. When he was released, he had seen the error of his ways. Both the dwarves had been in the same prison, and they had become allies, if not friends. ThuÕrum would never forget his sister, but he never saw his family again. Saddened, he became a heavy drinker. To make money, he acted as a fence for a gang, gettin in good terms with them. All ThuÕrum did was accept goods, and drink. This went on for 8 years. By the time ThuÕrum came to his senses, he was 107. He decided to stop helping the gang, and became a mercenary,. A guard for hire. He protected many caravans, and became quite well know. During one of his journeys, he encountered a bear. The rest of the guards ran in terror, but ThuÕrum stood his ground, angry that the caravan had been delayed. He roared loudly, and, much to everyoneÕs surprise, began to change. As he straightened up, he grew taller, nearly double his height, and his limbs got thicker. It was as if he had simply been leaning over, and now he straightened up. He sprouted thick brown fur, all over his body. Some of his humanoid features, such as hands, remained the same, and he still held his hammer and shield. He threw down his shield, gripped the hammer with both hands, and engaged the bear. A long fight ensued, both combatants wrestling back and forth. Eventually, ThuÕrum ripped the bearÕs throat out. Breathing heavily, he leaned against a tree, and returned to normal. He retrieved his tools, made an amulet out of the bearÕs claw, and continued on as if nothing had happened.\n",

This final job is what cemented both the funding for his new life and his legacy as the master rogue known to the public as \"22M\" bc all his thefts and assassinations were complete in under 22 minutes.\n",

Not knowing a life beyond the mercenaries, Ehrogar dedicated himself to becoming a ferocious fighter. He grew fiercely attached to the group, even as he grew older and understood the dark reality of his lifeÕs history. They were the only thing he could call a family, and he mostly felt pride in standing arm to arm with them, when their contracts were not as reprehensible as the one that brought him into their fold. One dreary winter morning, the bandÕs camp was taken by surprise and razed. Gravely wounded, knocked unconscious in the melee and left for dead, Ehrogar came to afterwards to discover he was the sole survivor of the massacre. Three years on, at 29 years of age, Ehrogar attempts to find his way in the world and make the best of his uncomfortably complete freedom, putting his fighting abilities to use in support of causes he believes to be in line with his strong sense of honor, loyalty, and purpose.\n",

      "But, despite all the neutrality and coldness in his voice, Tink could not refrain from knowing what kind of Higher Technical School he had been invited to. Mother Tinka on this occasion came to the city with her daughter, who by that time learned a lot from her mother. The mother initially objected a little, but was convinced Flare of the need for this training for the better future of her son. Obliging Tinka to write letters and, if possible, go home, his mother and sister went back to the village, and he began to collect things. The journey on the Stalingradsky train even more convinced him of the fidelity of his path. Tink settled in the hostel of the VTOS. Around him, a small group of like-minded people gathered and found several enemies - the unicorn stood out in a stream that consisted mainly of an earth-sitter - in one of the parallel groups Pegasus studied, who also joined the mug, as they were called on the stream, \"Crazy Inventors\". The school required attendance at lectures and good progress, but provided some freedom for its students. Members of the circle Tinka had time to learn and work - they had little money, which they spent on the purchase of various details. Then the circle gathered and often, in the silence of the night, explosions and gnashing of metal rattled. The administration of the hostel made comments and punished them, forcing them to sort out the consequences of their failures. But high scores in various competitions inside the VTsU provided this pony with immunity from exclusion. After the third year, most of the guys from the \"Crazy Inventors\" at a special meeting about their next victory were invited to join a secret organization - the Gray Knights. Those who could not receive training for various reasons, erased the memory. Of those who remained assembled the team and began to teach the possession of weapons. Tink was one of the first who learned to own swords. The team's talents gradually developed. The team was gradually invited to clean ziggurats, first as support. Magic unicorn himself studied, improving what turned out better. At the same time, for money, saved from dangerous adventures, Tink bought a cooperative 5-room apartment near the VTUs. His official work was the repair and creation of new models of electric and steam transport.al client. He did not seem to notice them, studying the goods and details of various products. In the end, curiosity prevailed over Tink and he asked why the client had such a strange weapon. In response, the strange pony smiled and began to tell the working Tinka about his adventures in big cities with skyscrapers and strange ponies that want other ponies only evil. His stories were full of daring arrests and pursuit on steam wagons. Tink listened and remembered the mother's stories about his father and their adventures. Gradually, in his telekinesis, a device with three large pulleys emerged, activating its elements from a small steam engine on the crystals. Turning the last bolt into the device, which took the form of a strange kind of knight, Tink felt a strange tingling in the sides. Suddenly the light shone from him in all directions - the unicorn got its own cutie mark. Three pulleys on the cutie mark resembled those that were on the device. The master went down to look at the strange light shining in the workshop. Tink handed him the device for verification. - Excellent design, and this drive, even I, I think, could not come up with more effective - praised the unicorn Flare. With this praise began the creative life of the red pony. An unusual pony left his business card:\n",

      " Euzalia grew up surrounded by family on a isolated homestead. Her grandmother directed this small clan of tielfings in their daily labors of farming, sheep herding, and all the other tasks necessary to maintain the homestead. They lived not too far away from a small human settlement where they often traded their products for the goods that they could not produce themselves. Despite multiple visits to this village, Euzalia remained naive to human traditions as the human's prejudice against tieflings kept her and her cousins from making any close friends there. As Euzalia grew she started to manifest many magical powers, often creating floating lights to entertain her little nieces and nephews and once stopping a group of sheep from running away in fear with her magic. Her grandmother identified this talent as the gift that occasionally appeared in family members due to their tiefling heritage, but no one encouraged Euzalia to develop her gifts, viewing them as interesting, but not particularly useful. As a young adult, Euzalia was once sent to trade at in the village without the supervision of her older family members. This visit ended in disaster when she lost her temper at a rude shopkeeper and set his house on fire. Euzalia insisted that it was a complete accident, but it seems more likely that the only accident was how out of control the flames became. Although no one was hurt in this incident, the villagers were understandably upset. Seeing the risk of mob violence, Euzalia's family, led by her grandmother, sent her away under the cover of night with instructions to not return until she had mastered better control of her powers and some time had past to allow tempers to die down. Euzalia respected the decision of her family and set our to see a bit of the world. As she traveled, she discovered that there was a lot more to the world than small villagers and homesteads. She loves seeing new things and is very curious about new people and places. Although she can be hesitant to trust strangers, she can be overly trusting of her friends and very easily influenced by peer pressure and others' opinions. Her immediate instinct is often to protect herself at the expense of others, but if reminded that that action would be morally wrong, she will decided to do the right thing (unless under the threat of mob violence, which she wants to avoid at all costs). She is much more likely to do go when others are watching as she wished to give a good impression of tieflings. She cared about her own personal honor, but not about the laws of some distant king. Despite her families' concerns, she has no fear of her sometimes uncontrollable magic and will laugh at the unintended consequences of her spells.\n",

They were threatened by extinction from a tribe of yuan-ti who were claiming the ruins and trying to resurrect a dead god sealed beneath it.  Wildrose couldn't stand for this (especially as the keystone of the ritual was a precious jewel with a composition unlike any other in the world), and so she rallied the rats to rise up against the reptilian cultists, discovering in the process that she was a natural leader and had an excellent mind for clever strategy and deadly traps.  The rats were victorious, sending the yuan-ti fleeing back to where they came from, and Wildrose left with the adulation of the rat clan.

After holding out for four days, the captain in charge of the cohort surrendered the fort to the Dragons, who treated the Whitestone soldiers honorably. Those who gave their paroleÑtheir binding word not to resist the occupation of the fort by the other mercenary companyÑwere permitted a great deal of freedom in and around the fort, though no weapons beyond a dagger. A few weeks into the occupation, another force was spotted approaching the fort. It proved to be the Sand Scorpions, a third company with a much more brutal reputation.  Duke von Schoenbeck had hired them to take his fort back...and when, after a few days, the captain of the Dragons met with the captain of the Scorpions under flag of parley to discuss surrender terms, he and his guards were slaughtered, in violation of the Code all three companies were sworn to adhere to. A long and bloody siege followed, in which the Dragons and the Whitestone Company fought side-by-side against the Scorpions. With both companies manning the defenses, the fort was too tough to break, but it wasn't long before supplies began to run out...especially when the Scorpions began using magic to ruin them from afar. After two months of siege, the defenders agreed they needed to get word out about the situation, and the Whitestone Company was closest. Geirolf and a half-dozen other men and women volunteered for a perilous mission to sneak past the besieging army and reach Duke von Schoenbeck's city with the news. Four survived the breakout, and were pursued relentlessly by squads of the Scorpions. By the time they reached the Whitestone outer pickets, only Geirolf and Adya, a woman from the Dragons, remained, and both were injured and feverish. Before they could deliver their message, the tenacious Scorpion pursuers caught up to them, and the Whitestone sentries died fighting them.

      "Output:\n",
      " Daefir NewLeaf is a Wood Elf, born of Vaxidor BrightStar and Zylralei FastWater. Daefir's child name was Naelar BrightWater. Daefir took his adult name at the spry young age of 80, when he led his first hunting party. Daefir was raised in the Wise Woods, and was brought up learning the ways of the healer, helping his mother Zylralei heal any wounded members of the clan. As well as learning to heal others, Daefir learned the ways of nature, and how important nature is to all life on the planet. 8 years after taking his adult name, Daefir was on a hunting mission by himself, wandering the Wise Woods tracking what seemed to be a herd of some beasts. Daefir followed the tracks to find a sight that horrified him: a clearing had been chopped into the woods, the mangled corpses of the trees tossed aside carelessly and unceremoniously. Scared and distraught, Daefir searched the clearing for any sign of what could have done this to his woods. Amongst some broken branches and some ashes, he found a small knife. Though it was nothing special, there was something off about this knife. Daefir was used to the elegant blades of the elves, but this knife was exactly the opposite: rough, blunt, and cruel - looking. He recalled a story his father had once told him that included blades very similar to the style of this blade. After some thought and pondering, he realized what he had found: the knife of an orc. Panicked, Daefir searched the clearing and quickly found the trail the orcs left as they deserted their camp. They were headed east, straight for the home of Daefir's clan. Daefir ran as fast as he could, tracking the scar the orcs had left across the forest, trying to catch up to them or beat them to his home. He had to warn his family, his friends, and his clan. Daefir ran for 25 miles, as fast as he could back to his home. Upon arrival, all that remained of his clans home were the signs of a battle: Bodies strewn across the forest floor; a few low burning flames; the stench of blood; and lastly, two lone, young lootahs. A rage swept over Daefir as he nocked an arrow and sent it through the heart of the first orc. Before the dead orc had even hit the ground Daefir was charging into the second orc with his blade drawn. A short fight burst out, the orc and the elf attacking with merciless fury. After a few seconds, the orc joined his friend upon the forest floor, dead. Daefir searched his clans home and found his parents, his friends, and every single one of his clan members dead, slain by the orc tribes cruel blades and maces. The elf wept, for a day and a night. Once he could weep no more, Daefir gathered the bodies of his clansmen, gave them an elvish funeral, buried the bodies in 8 large graves, one grave for every family of the clan, and returned them to nature. He then went to the orc bodies left strewn about, and cast them into the forest. From each orc body left behind by their brethren, Daefir took a single tooth. He strung these teeth together to keep as a necklace, and as a reminder of what the orcs have done to his family and to him. Daefir, covered in blood, dirt, sweat and tears, went to a nearby stream to clean himself. At the stream, he met a wizard. The human went by the name of (Daniel's Character), and he was kind to Daefir. The elf and the human became fast friends, and together they left the place that had been forever tainted for Daefir. They traveled north to the city of (whatever the city called lol) in search of knowledge and to bring forth what Daefir had learned: orcs are cruel and evil beings that must not be trusted. \n",

      "He was always the black sheep of the large clan, stuck mostly to himself and indulged his odd hobbies-- reading, studying plants, and exploring the deep jungle. Doing so, he  gained a reputation as someone full of secrets, self-reliant, and brave. Thus, when the Nexal clan was threatened with a mysterious outbreak of untraceable nightly wolf attacks, the Tabaxi king Hutsin reached out to Archer to join his Secret Service as an undercover asset. Archer, being a curious guy without a clear purpose, accepted the offer and was trained in the spy arts; his mission: investigate the source of these attacks while keeping watch on Hutsin. One day, while debriefing the King on his surveillance of the clan, Archer was taken by surprise; a hooded figure, silent and fast, flung Archer aside and sunk a dagger into the King's throat and ran out of the private chamber. Archer, stunned, regained his senses as guards found Hutsin's body. A lifetime of sneakiness and secretiveness instantly made him the #1 suspect. And so Archer fought off the guards as they went to arrest him and Archer gave chase to the hooded figure that only he had seen. Leaving his home behind, Archer has been tracking this assassin for months, all the way into the Underdark. There, he was stalled by his capture. He's been trying to get back on track ever since. One day, he will be able to clear his name, locate the source of his clan's mysterious wolf scourge, and restore order to his home. \n",

      " Charismatic; a true performer and an artist. Really intelligent and insightful, but generally considered a layabout even though he has two degrees from University (History and Philosophy) and is welcomed as a guest lecturer whenever he passes through. Adopted into a rich, noble elf family as a baby but has spent most of his adult life willingly skint and nomadic. His lifestyle is one of travel, poverty, and hedonism whenever he gets a chance - this lifestyle he believes is essential to artistic enlightenment. There may be some truth to this, as he is both well-known and acclaimed as a bard and a lutist. He is very street-smart (as a Tiefling in certain parts of the world, you almost have to be), but definitely prefers outwitting or escaping enemies rather than engaging in battle where his talents lack. When the DnD campaign starts, he is on a new continent he has never been to before, and relishes the chance for new inspirations, fresh crowds of admirers, and further avenues to debauchery. If this sounds really familiar, it's because he's a clone of Dandelion from the Witcher series - I'm new to this and still getting used to original character development.\n",

The party as it were, went on the monumental task of defeating a horde of evil humanoids set on destroying the world by using a suit that included many special items. This helmet, armor, gauntlets, sword and shield individually were powerful, but as a whole were devastating. In the first few weeks together Wiggly learned a few very powerful lessons. First quit while you are ahead, if the enemy is down, slitting its neck is much better than trying to continue attacking it and losing your weapon in the river. Second, always bring a backup weapon. Third keep less trained fighter/thieving types around, so that there are more targets for the enemies to attack. Last, Clerics are important to have with you, without them you have a high chance of dying.\n",

To get his son in line, his father sent him away to study under the Drunken Master. Huang was initiated into the Way of the Eight Drunken Immortals, and became adept in 7 of the 8 Drunken Fist styles. In the midst of a fight, he completed his training by creating his own unique style. He has become much more calm and gentle since then, although he is a heavy drinker now. Although he was brought up very traditionally, he is fascinated with Western culture and rejects his traditional upbringing. He often gave speeches against the government and his traditional way of life. Unable to get rid of him due to his fatherÕs influence, Huang was sent to study in Pa Kyo, the Shou Fou capital of Western culture. Ironically, this only introduced him to the Pa Kyo Group, a study group that advocated overthrowing the government and living in an agrarian society. Huang put his Drunken Boxing skills to the test by acting as one of the groups bodyguards against attacks by police and other pro-government forces, often proving himself to be a one-man army. He continued to study and train every day, also sinking deeper into the lore of the Eight Immortals. He particularly came to revere Li Tieguai, and attempts to emulate him in his fighting for the rights of the poor and healing of the sick with potions he carries around with him. He returned home, more incensed than ever against the government and more sure of himself. Unable to tolerate his presence but unable to defeat him, the government finally exiled him. He has been traveling ever since, often disguising himself as a weak, drunken beggar, ostensibly out of humility but also to throw off enemies into thinking he is not dangerous. He carries a bamboo stick with an iron core and wears a large brass earring. He is very mischievous and loves to use pranks to make powerful people look foolish.

It wasn't much different than the usual treatment, so she took advantage of the situation and used the neglect to live as she desired. Things were normal, or at least her idea of normal, for years. Her father, however, began making purchases he really couldn't. He got indebted to some of the wrong people and panicked. Since he didn't care much about his home life anyway, he set the place ablaze to fake his own death. Kaz was inside at the time the fire was set, spending time with her best friend, Sanric. In the ensuing panic and falling debris as they attempted to escape, Kaz was just slightly faster than Sanric. A wooden beam fell on her, and she used her strength to dodge it and fling it backwards. As a result, the beam landed on Sanric, trapping him. She instantly realized her mistake and desperately tried to lift it, but smoke was quickly filling her lungs and more debris kept falling on top of her and her friend. Eventually, she was forced to leave Sanric behind after another beam landed on top of the other beam and trapped him even further. Kaz fled to a smaller city in the country, Talonrest. She lived here with the grief of her lost friend and former life for some time. In that time, she found a temple dedicated to a righteous, broken God, Ilmater. She spent days in the temple studying his teachings and his miracles, eventually opting to become his devoted cleric. Later, Talonsrest was destroyed in another fire, set by a cult group dedicated to a rival God of Ilmater.

His natural intelligence served him well, but even more important was the fact that his earlier trauma had apparently attuned him to the element of fire in a deeper and more powerful way than anyone could have imagined.  However, along with this power came a deep sense of guilt for his family's deaths.  His aura, formerly bright and clear, slowly came to resemble the smoky flames of a funeral pyre. Eventually, he left the Brotherhood, dissatisfied with their inability, and his own, to cleanse him of his guilt.\n",

Not knowing who he was or what he was supposed to be doing Maestro fell in love with these gnomes despite the 3ft height difference and lack of any musical talent on his part. With the help of his new father modifications were made to his armoured form that allowed him to created music all of his own. This effect left him sounding like an accordion and a pair of bagpipes under a piano. Coupled with some facial modifications that allowed him to be more expressive, very uncharacteristic of a warforged, he was a monstrosity not seen since the works of Frankenstein. Still, a love of music was all he had left from the life he couldn't remember. This drove Maestro to become a full fledged bard. Nowadays he can be seen performing outside of taverns. Despite the excellent quality of his music, his off putting exterior often left him to earn coin by being paid to play in front of someone else's business.

Fi was interested in justice and fairness to a fault, and though I learned much of this attitude from her it has translated within me to a somewhat more harsh philosophy that everything ought to be for the good of the greatest number, and that no one is above that. \n",

Through his strength, dedication, and a word of recommendation from his Uncle, Faller was thrilled to acquire a steady job with the city guard, and swore to do what he could to make his family proud and his city safer. But as the years passed, his excitement at his prospects slowly faded as it became clear that he was to be shuffled to the sidelines, mostly given drunktank and archive duty while occasionally being called in to intimidate particularly uncooperative suspects. Frustrated by the disdain of his boss, his inability to prove himself, and his nonexistant prospects to advance, Faller decided to take matters into his own hands. He began to look into old unsolved cases in his free time, and then eventually into open ones as well, throwing himself into questionable and far fetched avenues of investigation that his colleagues wouldn't consider.

However, he was anything but. Even as a half-elven child growing up in a primarily human city, he attracted little attention, always sort of fading into the background despite his best efforts. He didnÕt have the makings of an underdog either Ð his human father, Randal Amblecrown, and his elven mother, Miale Holimion Amblecrown, were caring, supporting, and fairly wealthy. He was encouraged to pursue his musical talents and join the ranks of the prestigious (insert human city name here) orchestra. And he did. But Temur wasnÕt happy with being just another note in the chord. He wanted to stand out, be noticed, have thousands of people chanting his name. He left his classical position, but he still faced a problem. But with such a vanilla and unopposed story, he would not catch anybodyÕs attention. So he decided to create his own arch-nemesis. He created Mindartis Anastacia, a High Elven musician whose incredible talent with the violin was matched by his arrogant and pretentious attitude. This elf viewed himself as above the people, gracing them with a gift of superior music. So some nights Temur would go out as Mindartis, visiting taverns, playing his violin, singing Elven songs of mythology, and just being a general snob. Other nights Temur would go out as himself, visiting the same taverns, playing his lute, singing rowdy songs in Common, and generally presenting himself as a humble hero of the people.\n",

When some wizards cam ans slowed time, TiaÕSac was unaffected by it. The alchemists decided that it was perfect, and decided to use TiaÕSacÕs blood to make more. But TiaÕSac was not to be contained. He was a person. One alchemist, Professer Lorrimor, realized this, and, asking for only a favour in return, set TiaÕSac free, with directions to a village to live in. He collapsed near an orc village, and was brought back to it. He lived there for many years, rising through the ranks with feats of strength and dexterity.

      "Output:\n",
      " Keagan was a curse to his parents. His father, a well respected elf ranger by the name of Lord Ellannan the Ranger, and his mother, a human ranger in a small town by the edge of the elvesÕ territory who was called Gurthana Serpenthelm, met in the woods whilst doing various tasks. Gurthanna was out hunting, and Elannan was scouting out new territory for the elven king. They both saw each other, but under the canopy of the trees it was dark, and even though they both had vision accustomed to these environments, they failed to realise they were of different races. They spoke for a time, neither realizing that something had fallen over them. Perhaps it was their tiredness, or something far more sinister in the woodsÉ Nevertheless, they loved each other very much, that night. They decided to sleep out in a hunting lodge. By the time they arrived, they were both tired, so they didnÕt bother with lighting a candle, or the fire. Instead, they both crawled into bed, and made love. In the morning, however, Elannan woke up, and, realizing what he had done, killed himself. Took his hunting knife, and stabbed himself twice in the gut, and once in the chest. He bled out on the floor. Gurthanna woke up minutes later, and saw Elannan lying on the planks, dead. His hair had fallen over his ears, and Gurthanna, blinded by grief, still didnÕt realize that he was an elf. She fled the cabin, and ran back to town. She concealed her grief well, though some people notice a slight change in her behaviour. She had stopped going out into the woods to hunt, and stayed at home for longer periods of time. 8 months later, Keagan was born. His elvish blood wasnÕt apparent at first, but by the age of 5 his ears were more pronounced. His mother tried to hide him from the village, but it was inevitable that he would venture outside. By the age of 11, his mother had great trouble, keeping him inside. It was also at this age that he began getting far more elegant and graceful than any pureblooded human. When Keagan turned 14, he snuck outside for the first time. He became quite good at this, eventually. By the age of 15, it was apparent to even him that he wasnÕt fully human. He decided to keep this a secret, though, and wove a net of lies, and made a mask of naivety. These skill would help him later in his life. By the age of 17, Keagan took up fencing and knife throwing to pass the time. Eventually, he bored of fencing imaginary opponents, so he bid his mother farewell. But, instead of doing this verbally, he snuck out in the dead of night, leaving a note for his mother to find. He wore his cloak with the hood up, to conceal his face, and slouched slightly to conceal his height. He took only his rapier and kunai. He travelled East, with no destination in mind, following the road. He kept following it as it grew wider, a sign that he was getting closer to a larger city. It was here that he put his disguising abilities to the test. He came upon a caravan, and was trying to pass it, when the owner ran up to him. The owner had seen KeaganÕs sword, and needed some more guards on the caravan. Keagan declined at first, but the owner offered him a large sum of gold. He accepted, if only because he needed the gold. They were a few hours from the city when bandits attacked. Keagan had dismounted his horse to give it some rest, and when the bandits attacked, his horse bolted. Keagan dove into the bushes, to avoid incoming crossbow fire, and snuck towards the bandits. There were five of them, and only one of him. All the other defenders had been shot full of crossbow bolts. As the bandits drew near, he silently grabbed his kunai, and unsheathed his sword. Once the bandits drew level with Keagan, he threw his kunai. It hit the lead bandit straight in the chest. He charged out and fell a second with a quick slash to the throat. His speed and stealth allowed him to stab a third, before the remaining two realised what was going on. Keagan retrieved his kunai, and ducked under a swing. The bandits had maneuvered so one was on his left, and one on his right. He parried a blow from the left, and staggered as the flat of a sword hit him in the chest. He thought quickly, as he stumbled backwards, and then he threw himself backwards. He clutched at his chest, feigning pain. The bandits inched forwards, eager to finish him off. Quick as lightning, KeaganÕs hand flashed out, throwing his kunai. It missed. The bandits followed it with their eyes. Seconds later they were both dead, easily dispatched with a few blows from a chakram Keagan had found on a corpse he had fallen next to. Keagan tore a few strips of cloth off a banditÕs shirt, and wrapped his left hand; the chakram had cut him when he swung it. He never took those strips off, keeping them as a memento of his first kills. He realised that as a half-elf, he would never fit in, and he loathed that fact. He realised he enjoyed killing these men, then shook his head. He must stay true to what his mother taught him. Only kill when necessary. But.. Keagan decided to put this moral dilemma off for the moment. He spoke with the owner of the caravan, who was very grateful, and they continued onwards. Once they reached the town, Keagan received his pay. He decided to stay in town for a while. There he stayed, honing his skills of stealth and deception, mastering the art of killing by being an assassin. He did this for 3 years, then set out for the coast. He hoped to get an overseas mission, and see the world. When he arrived, he attempted to resume work as usual. A few months later, he was approached by the mercenariesÕ guild. They wanted him to be part of the guild, As a medium ranking agent. He accepted, on the terms that the guild would provide for him, at least in the city, and also pay him a small salary. Soon after he joined, he was given his first mission. It was to go see an old man by the name of Jacel, and assist him in his goal.\n",

Little did he know this adventure would be nothing like his previous onesÉMaybe it might have something to do with this bong, not like I know any magic though.Ó So Bobo followed close behind him, but far enough away so the gorilla could not see him. Eventually, as the sun was setting, the gorilla decided to head to his home, which turned out to be a rather sophisticated abode, built above the tree line with a cave for support. After an hour or so of the gorilla entering the home, Bobo entered the cave to find what was hidden in there, and in there he found a huge pile of bananas! But Bobo took too long admiring the bananas, and as he turned around he saw the ape looming over him, and upon closer inspection found he wore a red necktie with the letters ÒDKÓ written on them. Bobo did the only thing he could in that moment, and took a huge hit from his bong, and played his bongos like no tomorrow. As it turned out the gorilla had bongoÕs too and played along with him. They played all through the night and were able to communicate with the beats of the drums, during which Bobo learned that DK was angry because he couldnÕt find any more bananas, which he needs to live. They both went to sleep however covered in used banana peels. In the morning then, Bobo went outside the cave to start the day off right, with weed. He leaned up against a tree and began to blow smoke into the leaves. But the most interesting thing happened just then, the tree started growing more bananas instantly all over the branches! Knowing the struggle of his friend DK, he decided to help him, so he went around to every banana tree in the area and blew nice large smoke clouds into the leaves so they would all sprout bananas. A few hours later DK woke up and noticed what had happened and became ecstatic, he almost accidentally crushed Bobo! DK then went out and picked all the bananaÕs that he could and brought them back to his cave. That night they feasted on bananas, weed, and music. This went on for nearly 7 years, during which DK, which was short for Donkey Kong, also made a weed garden for Bobo and taught him the little magic he knew. But one day Gary showed up again and told Bobo it was time for another adventure, telling him to go the north where there will be a town that is in need of him. Unfortunately this exit was not as quick as last time, so Bobo had to explain to DK why he had to go, and how when Gary says he needs to go somewhere, he must go there, after all that was how they met. After a long gorilla-hug-filled goodbye, with promises to return, Bobo set off on yet another adventure.\n",

When asked about her past, she had already formed a perfect storyÑnot a lie, but not the whole truth either: her father, not wanting a daughter, drove her off the farm, and sheÕd been living on the streets since, surviving by virtue of her voice. The rest of the minstrels took quickly to her, with the exception of one Theresa, a specialist in the lute, who was not so easily swayed. Within the group, they became somewhat of a pair of rivals, with CassandraÕs swelling pride causing competition and contention between them. At 14, Cassandra was the youngest member of the group, and the honour of having been accepted had gone heavily to her head, causing her to frequently egg Theresa on. The rivalry persisted, and though, in many cases, it only served to intensify their shared passion for the work, it only took a year for the arrangement to finally come to a head. In the midst of a high-profile performance, Theresa began her lute solo. Cassandra, however, cut the solo off early to begin singing again. As a result, Theresa began to play more loudly to try and drown her out. This exchange of one-upmanship continued throughout the performance until they broke into a full-on physical fight and the whole group had to be dragged out of the bar. It was that night that the WorldÕs Widows agreed the two of them would have to settle their differences before either could be allowed on stage again. It was also that night when, after the performance, Cassandra was changing in her room, and Theresa came in unexpectedly. Seeing Cassandra naked, Theresa accused her of being a man pretending to be a woman. Before Cassandra could explain, Theresa ran off to the others and told them everything. By a majority vote, Cassandra was cast out of the WorldÕs Widows, and left to fend for herself. In desperation, she returned to the inn where she had first begun performing, only to find her spot taken by another singer, and be unrecognized by the bartender. Having lost the spirit to try and go in and prove herself again, Cassandra moved on, drifting from city to city, singing her sorrows in the streets to get her meals, hoping against hope that she would one day get an opportunity to reclaim her honour. As she wandered, she practiced. She honed her skills with the bow. She wove her voice into more and more potent magicks. And she prepared herself for danger, with the styles taught to her by the WorldÕs Widows. Years of folk heroism prepared her for the moment when she received her summons to Navrim, to fight on behalf of the lords of the realm. And so, she set off, in hopes of becoming a hero worthy of the songs of the WorldÕs Widows, to take her place among legends. trained with blades and bows alike, taught to defend herself on the road.

As a scoundrel, a fast-talker, and a brilliant negotiator, Navasi is happiest when the chips are down and lives hang in the balance, as that's when you truly know who your friends are. Above all, she knows to always look beneath the surface, for like Navasi herself, nothing is ever quite what it seems.nd had never spoken of religion, Navasi took it as a sign, and even holds out some hope that perhaps her companion might have been more than she seemed, though she recognizes that such thoughts are probably just a manifestation of her grief.\n",

      " Vaana grew up with loving parents who were the guards of a merchant family, sea-faring traders in an archipelago-like region. She was used to being carefree & this was encouraged by her parents, who were similar. When she struck out on her own, she found an adventuring party and wrote back to her parents frequently. After a few years, she heard from her parents that they were giving up their sea-faring lifestyle and moving inland, which struck her as odd. She cut ties with her adventuring party (involving angst, since none of them cared enough to return with her, despite the fact they'd been friends for years) and went to check on her parents, to find that they were all right, but getting a bit too old for that lifestyle. She devoted herself to caring for them as they aged, and helped as much as she could, but still lost them when she was around 40 years old. She decided to stay in their house (basically in the middle of nowhere in the woods) and withdraw from interacting with others, coming to terms with her parents' deaths. She continued to hone her talents as a ranger, hunting and foraging for food and survival. She eventually befriended a fishing cat who became her familiar - named Blue, after her preference for bluefin tuna in the river near their prowling grounds. She was brought out of retirement and met her current party (at the start of this campaign) through a contract that the dean of a somewhat-nearby university specifically requested her for, to kill a lich that had been terrorizing the area. Vaana, having a strong preference for the natural order of things over necromantic leanings, felt a calling to join up and fight, and brought Blue with her. TL;DR: badass, antisocial, grumpy old lady and her wild cat friend have a good time killing a lich with fellow partymembers, a dying elf and a robot.\n",

      "-\tWhen I left the library I was just in time to join Jumper and Tolir on a return trip to the caves.  I noticed the stones around one of the cages is marked with the light symbol in draconic, apparently it was part of what was keeping one of the creatures caged.  The cages were of interesting construction though.  One was made of glass, one of metal and the last was made of stone.  The stone one is the one that is ringed by the stones.  I would deduce that they were specially made to contain the creatures that the mage was trying to create.  There is no way tell exactly how old they are but I would say very.  The metal is rusted and the stones of light were made by a high-level mage so could have been active for centuries at least.  The spell appears to be spent though, I wonder, do they only shine at night?  Could the sunÕs presence be enough to contain that creature during the day, even underground?  What was finally strong enough to break the cages after so long a time?  Magic could have done it, after all there are spells to turn metal to rust and uncreate anything.  What mage around here is strong enough to overcome the original wards and why would they without firm control over the creatures released?  Were the creatures that escaped the originals or the offspring of the originals?  How does this tie into TolirÕs activities? Is he a mage or more likely, does he have one on his payroll?  I will have to make a point to come down here at night, as repellent as that thought is.  I canÕt seem to make out anymore of the writing though.  ItÕs maddening, it looks like I should know it, but I canÕt read it for anything!!  Grok started getting nervous and said he was ready to leave, cosidering what happened last time he came here IÕm surprised he came back.  I really should find out if heÕs dreamed anything else useful.  I decided to call it a early day and get some practice on the way back.  IÕm going to try hunting these things at night tonight.  IÕll ask the rest of the guys who appear to be somewhat useful to come along as well.  TolirÕs not going to be one of them though.  His condescending attitude is starting to wear thin.  Especially considering IÕm old enough to have bounced his GRANDFATHER on my knee!!!\n",

One day while reading in the library they learned of an ancient tomb, possibly unopened, nearby. The two journeyed out to it and determined that the seal on the entrance was unbroken. Excited to uncover new treasures, the two delved into the tomb, disarming the traps in the halls with ease. When they finally made it to the treasure room, they discovered that it had been looted. Someone had dug a tunnel into the back and taken all the gold. The only remaining bit of treasure was a golden ring on the finger of a skeletal lord. Gill removed the ring, and in doing so awoke all the skeletons in the room. They attacked him and killed him, ripping the flesh from his bones. Finn barely made it out alive. Unable to stand the thought of his best friend's fate, Finn re-entered the tomb a month later. Using tomb's existing traps and his superior wits Finn systematically killed all the skeletons over the course of a few days. When he finally made it into the treasure room again Finn came face to face with his best friend's skeleton. Without hesitation, he caved in Gill's skull with his crowbar, ending his undead servitude. As a final memento, Finn took the ring off Gill's finger and put it on his own, keeping it as a reminder of his friend. Now, he adventures not only for his own dreams, but for those of his fallen friend.\n",

Despite this, she loves them fiercely and always imagined someday they would return to her so they could finally be a family. Unbeknownst to Borba, her mother is on a mission to rescue her father from his Orc tribe, the Spine Breakers who abducted him for leaving the tribe many years ago for seeking a civilized life, a huge offence to his clan. Borba befriends the elderly in the monastery and learns much from their pacifist and nature-loving ways like caring for nature and the weak. If she is not exploring the forest, Borba is in the company of Sir Gregory, her best friend and ex-paladin from the Order. Fascinated with the tales of his life as a paladin, Borba requests that her old friend teach her how to become one too. Under his tutelage, Borba undergoes rigorous paladin training and learns how to heal wounds and wield a halberd. One day, her typical training session goes awry because Borba got distracted with the fantasy of her parents returning. Sir Gregory berates her for this, causing her to run deep into the forest to cry. Lost in her emotions, Borba fixates on the thought of being abandoned forever by her parents. This triggers her innate Orc bloodlust, causing her to wreck havoc on the trees around her. She passes out from the exhaustion of it all and dreams of a mystical Elk that assures Borba that her parents will not abandon her and that they are serving nature. The elk sees potential in Borba as a defender of nature and promises her that it will aid her should she venture forth to find her father. In return, Borba must protect nature and educate others on the importance of its preservation. Excited, Borba accepts the gift and takes the Oath of the Ancients. Before the dream ends, the Elk tells Borba that her necklace (a gift from her mother) will guide her way to her parents. When she wakes up, Borba rushes back to explain what happened to Sir Gregory and expresses her intentions to find her father. Guilty, Sir Gregory tells her the truth about her parents and supports her wishes to find him. When she is 17, she completes her training and leaves her old friends in the monastery to embark on a mission of reuniting her family. Her first stop is at a nearby village called Langdale, where Sir GregoryÕs old friend is waiting for her.\n",

      " Akacheta, or Aki for short, was raised in a flock of other Aarakocra high in a mountain range. He and his father were ostracized from other Aarakocra and lived alone on the outskirts of their rural village. Aki's father suffered from visions of threatening spirits, and often fell into fits of hallucination and fearful screams in public. However, his father wasn't the only threat to the peace. An evil organization of monks, the Monks of the Long Death, made their home not far from the sanctity of Akacheta's village. Seeing Aki cast out from the population made him their next project. The monks' leader, a nameless, ancient Kenku man, approached young Aki during one of the many instances he was entirely alone. The old man put a mangled wing around the small bird's shoulders and croaked a string of horrible words into his ear. From that moment on, Aki was never the same. He became even more finicky than before. He was paranoid that he was being watched. But he wasn't able to remember the Kenku man or what he said, or even what he was really afraid of. The rest of the Aarakocra just saw it as Aki following in his old man's footsteps. Eventually, Aki's father's condition deteriorated, and on his deathbed he made Akacheta promise to never become like him and to never be so afraid that he cannot live. At the time of his father's death, Aki was nearing adulthood. It was at this time that the Kenku monk decided it would be best to take Aki under his wing, so to speak. When approached, Ali was neither afraid or at all unhappy to see the man. He only felt compelled to comply with his wishes. After years of training by the Long Death monks, and after his mind became clearer and sharper, the monks' hold on Aki was deteriorating. He became aware of what was truly happening in that awful place. The monks weren't just a group of creepy self-proclaimed outcasts, they were all devoted to the same goal: finding a way to prevent death itself. They studied victims intensely, keeping them teetering on the brink of death in order to observe the process. Aki was naturally horrified by their purpose, and regained full control of his thoughts and actions. He used his newly-sharpened skills to fight his way out of the monks' hideout and never looked back. However, once his mind was no longer clouded, he began noticing a figure almost always at the edge of his vision. He heard whispers when he laid his head down to sleep. He slowly came to the realization that this was his inheritance; the very same visions his father had described. But he refused to become fearful. Instead, he fought his own fear by ridding others of theirs. He became a sort of mercenary, and travelled across the land devoting himself to relieving the world of its evils. For a price, of course; a man has to make a living somehow.\n",

There were 2 others there, the one I recognized was one-twoly, a large human.  The other was someone IÕd never seen before, a dwarf who introduced himself as Da Morgan, he appears to be a cleric.  We decided to head towards the mountain in the distance.  It took all day but we found a cave entrance and decided to do some exploring.  We went down the passage and came across a large room that looked like a temple.  In the center there was a shield and a hammer. one-twoly picked up the shield and it transformed to look like a pair of  bracers.  No one could lift the hammer and so we left it.  We found three boxes on a shelf in the back of the alter.  We each took one and opened them.  Mine had a copper headband that I decided to wear.  I put the box in my bag and continued to look for further treasure.  Copper found a hidden passageway and there was an alchemistÕs lab at the end of it.  There was a shelf of extremely rare spell componets that I took all of and another of potions that I stocked up on.  We found another room that was full all kinds of things.  I found a magical elven thin blade, some boots, a set of bracers, 2 bracelets, a necklace and 8 rings to wear.  I put a bunch of other stuff in my bag.  I keep seeing the same design on all of this stuff and I think it is a forge mark of some kind, this stuff looks like masterwork quality stuff.  Copper found enough bracelets to entirely cover his body.  He looks kinda cute, like a weasel ready for battle.  The guys got weapons that actually talk to them.  My sword doesnÕt talk, at least it hasnÕt yet.  Copper led us to another room that had a bunch of switches in it.  We finally got them turned to the right combo and 4 doors opened off another big room.  We decided to take a break before when any further.  There was nothing else of interest in the caves.  It took awhile but we made it to town and each decided that even though it had been profitable, it was time to make our own way.  \n",

By a strange coincidence upon Aelar's 25th birthday, a wizard who had previously resided in the village, Adorellan Xyrphine, returned and asked for an apprentice to assist him at his tower. Many elvish parents offered their children to him, but he choose Aelar because he \"looked bored.\" After returning to the tower, fresh apprentice in tow, Adorellan began teaching Aelar the art of the arcane. Seven years later, after a lecture was interrupted by the sudden heaving of bloody vomit, Adorellan revealed he was dying of a mysterious curse he received while researching his life's work, the creatures of the lower planes. The curse was resistant all the forms of removal attempted; the most that could be done was slow its progress. As it continued to ravage his body Adorellan concocted a plan: acquire an apprentice, train them all he could in his limited time, reveal his plight, and then seal himself himself away with an ÒImprisonÓ spell, locked away by a phrase only his apprentice would know, until the time came that the curse was identified and a cure found. With the parting words of Òcontinue my researchÓ the wizard removed himself from the flow of time until the fated day that Aelar succeeds in his quest. After 140 years of traveling to countless libraries and obtaining any and all information relating to this curse and more generally the lower planes, Aelar realized the easiest way to learn more of them was to encounter the creatures of it in person. Taking the basic knowledge of magic his master had taught him and his desire to learn more of all creatures, Aelar looked for a sufficiently desperate party that was willing to let him join until he came across as strange man with a lisp.\n",

      "\n",
      "Output:\n",
      " Alacrity was raised in a secluded cult devoted to the goddess Emizah. The cult believes the tieflingsÕ ÒcurseÓ can be eradicated through centuries of devotion down the bloodlines and intermarrying with humans. For some in the cult, this devotion takes the form of monastic combat training and harnessing of oneÕs ki. They were never a perfect student, but developed their skills well within the context of the cult. For most tieflings in the cult, including Alacrity and their sister Penitence, devotion also means marrying and having a child with a human. The pressure is even greater for them, because by the reckoning of the cult, their bloodline should be purified enough that any children either of them have with a human should be a human rather than a tiefling. When Alacrity is 22, Penitence gives birth to her first child. When the infant is discovered to be a tiefling, Penitence is killed, in accordance with the cultÕs rules (her husband is imprisoned and the child disappears). Alacrity, furious and terrified, flees the cult at once. With no experience of life outside the cult, Alacrity struggles to find a place for themself in the major city in which they wash up. To make matters worse, in the wake of their shattered faith, theyÕve lost control of their ki abilities. After bumming around for a while, a lost and rain-soaked Alacrity meets Corbett, a half-elf. Corbett takes them home and gives them a place to stay. Alacrity is icy at first, being a negative person by nature, and not liking the vulnerable position theyÕre in. Corbett is a perfect gentleman, never for a moment expressing sexual interest in his new roommate. With time, things change. Corbett works with the underserved people of the city, doing whatever needs doing and advocating for folks who find themselves in legal trouble. He also knows a little bit of healing magic, and can help people with minor injuries and illnesses. Alacrity soon joins him on these visits, helping where they can, and slowly finding their footing in the outside world. Slowly, too, Alacrity and Corbett fall in love. They have years together. They live a meager, marginalized life in the big city, but theyÕre happy with each other. Mostly, that is. A wedge that was there from the start eventually drives between them: AlacrityÕs past. Alacrity canÕt bear to speak to Corbett about the cult, and about the trauma they suffered throughout their youth, and on that final day when Penitence died. The secrets stop Alacrity from being as open and vulnerable as love requires, and silences turn to snaps turn to arguments with no resolution. One day, Alacrity leaves. They move to a different part of the city, just as impoverished, and spend weeks in misery and intoxicants. They surface from the bender one morning to a bright flash of light, and a heavy voice begins speaking to them. The voice belongs to Emizah, the goddess worshipped by the cult Alacrity grew up in. Only, Emizah says, they donÕt truly worship her at all. Emizah has no strictures about purity that can ÒcleanseÓ tieflings. In fact, the nature of the cult is abhorrent to her. She values all life above any other concern, whether human or tiefling or anything else. That the cult has been killing people in her name is a blasphemy of the highest order. Unfortunately, she has lost her ability to act directly on the material plane, and canÕt personally do anything to stop them. Instead, she recruits people to her cause, and to devotion to her. In return, she gives them divine power. Alacrity is immediately resistant, telling her to fuck right off. What do they owe her? They donÕt want anything except some peace and quiet to succumb to their depression in. But Emizah knows what Alacrity went through, and she knows how deeply their hatred for the cult runs. She entices them with one last request: in exchange for divine magic, Alacrity will personally take down the people that killed their sister. Alacrity agrees. For years, they take up the mantle of a wandering healer, though they keep the source of their power obscure. Alacrity has no desire to be seen as associated with the cult, the only people who worship Emizah openly, and so dodges questions that get too close to the secret. All the while, Emizah occasionally directs them to perform tasks that, she swears, will bring Alacrity closer to their revenge. Eventually, at the age of 30, they are recruited to act as medic on an inter-planar ship.\n",

A hairline crack ran from the top of the egg halfway down the side, sustained when her dwelling in the kith had burned. As she stared at the egg, it began to wobble in her hands. Startled, she dropped it into the sand, where it landed with a soft pff. It wiggled under the hot summer sun just long enough for her to put it together. Heat! It was the warmth of the fire, of the sun, that had allowed it to begin hatching. Hesitantly, she reached out her right arm to touch the egg. She had become more skilled since her exile, and wreathed her hand in low, flickering flames. Warming the egg, she watched as it split open to reveal a small, scaly form. Her eyes widened.

Unfortunately, it was not long after they arrived that they discovered the woods were much more sinister than any they had ever seen. A darkness was creeping over the land, and soon packs of wolves twisted by dark magic prowled closer and closer to the settlement, making leaving the village next to impossible. They made a life for themselves, even if Belle constantly chafed at the rest of the villagers, considering them stupid and shallow. She dreamed of the day she could leave, but did not expect that day to come in the form of her father disappearing into the woods. Loathe to tell Gaston or anyone else of her plans, and convinced she could handle the situation herself, she trailed her father to the castle deep in the woods and confronted the monster within. While tales of heroic sacrifice and impossible romance in her head, she agreed to stay in the castle forever if her father was set free, unable to comprehend what horrors awaited her. The prince of the castle was no fairytale prince, and he cared not for her attempts at kindness. She was chained to a demonic altar as a virgin sacrifice when Gaston burst in, the magnanimous hero come to save her, the damsel in distress, the very thing she'd always loathed and swore never to become. In that moment, she honestly didn't know which was worse: being sacrificed to open a portal to hell, or having to witness Gaston save her and then never shut up about it. By time he listened to her angry screams and released her, every evil thing was already dead, every mirror smashed, and there was nothing left to take out her rage on except her own psyche. Her belief in romance and fairy tales died in that castle as well, and while she still found Gaston to be boorish and pigheadedly misogynistic, she found she didn't care nearly as much as she used to. When Gaston, Claudette, and Scarlett set plans to leave the village to go \"adventuring,\" Belle asked to join them. At least finally she would get out, even if she now knew there was nothing out there but more blood and ichor.\n",

After his parents died he was left a sizable inheritance and he had no one other than his childhood friend, Randal Buckman. Randal nicknamed him ÔAndorÕ because Stedd couldnÕt pronounce his middle name until later in life. When they became adults, Randal joined the military and Stedd wanted to follow in his footsteps to do his part to protect the innocent. Due to his poor health he was denied entry until a commander named Zasheir Rein decided to use Stedd to create the ultimate soldier. Through arcane magic and intense training, Stedd grew stronger and became known as the ÔStormwindÕ due to his battle prowess as the legionÕs finest fighter. During a secret mission, Randal went missing and was presumed dead. Stedd defied orders and broke rank to avenge him by pursuing the man responsible, Grigor Dotsk. Grigor was the leader of a group known as the ÔSeven Headed SerpentÕ who worshipped an ancient beast as a god. The beast was known as ÔCullÕ and would absorb people into a ÔHive mindÕ in order to use them as slaves to the DemonÕs will. After a harrowing campaign, Stedd put a stop to Grigor's plans and the cult. He chose to take Grigor prisoner instead of taking his life because he knew it would never bring back his friend. Stedd was rewarded for his victory and made a Captain with a unit under his command. Captain SteddÕs crew was known as the Grand Rangers. It's brand was an image of a howling wolf and his trusted lieutenants were Dorn Dundragon, Kerri Chernin, and Morn Falone, He led his unit to many other later victories and for many years but each felt more hollow. Eventually, he left the service and his friends to explore the world and find his new path. He still wears the badge of his rank, a silver shield over his heart emblazoned with a howling wolf and a golden star with a gold chevron at the top. Buckman is still presumed dead. Stedd was ReinÕs only success but many others now want to replicate his work. The Grand Rangers were disbanded and his lieutenants moved on to command their own units. Since then, he walks the world alone carrying with him the emblem of the Seven Headed Serpent on a piece of a ripped banner to remind him of his loss and the evil he hopes to have wiped from existence.

Her name was lost to time, as the arch-fey did not accept her naming as Lunilla (as all true names hold power, and this name does not. In time, she accepted herself as the nameless one).

Due to their bust schedules Dorion spent most of his time alone, wandering the forests and other natural areas of the world. Dorion became fascinated by nature and particularly a family of brown bears living in the area, for years Dorion studied this family of bears, forsaking his chores and working life to disappear into the woods and become part of the great ecosystem. Whilst living largely in the wilderness Dorion learned to channel the power of nature, despite generally being considered a weak child Dorion learned to move with grace and lethality through the forests. However when he was but 30 years old bold orc hunting parties started frequenting the forest. After they had killed several members of his beloved bear family, a distraught Dorion marshalled the animals of the wood and lead a swift, brutal assault on the orc camp. Dorion himself slew the orc chieftain in hand to hand combat, ducking around the slow clumsy blows of his greataxe and cutting him down. Afterwards Dorion searched the camp and found a baby orc crying desperately for his parents. Dorion could not bring himself to slay the innocent child and left the baby orc outside one of the major orc encampments. Fearing how his parents would react to his blatant acts of aggression Dorion fled from the island. For many years afterwards he travelled the wild learning all he could about the natural world. Gradually he understood how rash his actions had been and that alternatives to bloodshed should always be pursued if at all possible. Dorion generally spends most of his time in the wilds, living alongside the animals of the wilds. He will occasionally rest in a village paying his way with rare flowers and trophies from animals. Whilst he has mellowed over time Dorion is still a staunch defender of the natural world and canÕt abide large cities and towns which donÕt somehow incorporate nature into their construction. \n",

Now, Pike (which is what all of his friends call him) is an odd Kobold to say the least. He was barely a hatchling when an adventuring party wiped out his home den and set him adrift in the surface world. Lonely, tiny, half blind, and desperate, Pike somehow found his way into the lair of an Ancient Silver Dragon, Shamalundith, and her mate, Koriasith. Taking pity on the tiny creature, Shamalundith took him in and raised him as if he were a hatchling, and now, Pike fully believes himself to be a silver dragon. He would often wander into the nearby town, keeping low and to the sides, just to examine the melting pot of creatures and to sate his natural curiosity. He discovered his draconic blood around the age of 4, and began practicing the art of sorcery with the help of Shamalundith, and even though his draconic blood wasn't inherently Silver, he was so disheartned and confused that Shamalundith and Koriasith wove a spell to alter it. He is now a proficient burglar and fledgling sorcerer, much to the chagrin of Shamalundith, and he gives his all in an attempt to build his own little hoard. Shamalundith has been a huge impact in his life, teaching him how to control his magic, how be use a blade, how to survive, but most of all, how to respect life. On the 6th anniversary of his appearance in her cave, Shamalundith gifted Pike with a set of adventuring gear sized for him and a magic bag to hold his little treasure hoard before sending him out into the world to carve his own destiny. He still often returns home to visit his mother and deposit what he has earned or stolen onto his ever growing little hoard. \n",

      " I spent most of my life as a humble farmer, working the land and tending my familyÕs livestock. My village was simple, and we thought the world a much smaller place than it is. But that all changed one day. The first sign of trouble was the goblin raids. They were infrequent at first, but it grew into a war. The Goblin War. Something had to be done, so after the fourth goblin attack I founded a militia to protect the village, and we called ourselves the Brotherhood of Pitchforks. I trained the villagers to fight using our makeshift weapons: hoes, axes, pitchforks, and the like. As the goblinÕs attacks became more ferocious, so did we in the Brotherhood. It was five years from the first goblin raid to the end of the war, and I think we must have exterminated the goblins. By this point many of us villagers were seasoned veterans, so when the giants showed up, wanting to take our land and force us to pay taxes to their king, we resisted. We fought off their first attack easily enough, they hadnÕt expected much from a village of halflings, but after a while they came back bringing all their tools of war. Humans really are remarkable warriors when they put their minds to it, and their massive size at nearly twice the height of a halfling gives them an edge. The trick is to go for their knees, and to keep your shield skyward. At one point during the battle, a trebuchet destroyed the granary, and at this point I become flooded with a righteous fury. This was the point that the god of strength had chosen me, and it was as if I was indestructible. I fought and killed two hundred human warriors that day, and the few that remained were terrified of me. But they placed a bounty on my head so large that others would come and assault my village, trying to get at me. Eventually I had to leave for the sake of everyone else. And now I am on the road, a wanderer, wondering why the god chose me.\n",

      "Sydna is a former sister-scholar of an order of Oghma and as such had devoted her life to knowledge and understanding the arcane. In the kingdom where her order resided, a lord and his order of knights demanded the secret knowledge the sisterhood retained regarding neighboring factions. To the angered disappointment of the lord, the sisters refused to get involved and locked away any books or scrolls relevant to what the knights were searching for. Weeks later, on a fall night, Sydna awoke to screams and metal footsteps. The knights had broken into the compound and began ransacking and slaughtering the sisterhood. Sydna ran to her mentors room where she was already ushering in some of the younger sisters into a secret passage. As Sydna was the last to crouch into the passage, her mentor gave her a book of gods before sealing the entrance with her on the other side. Sydna rushed down the passage, as she heard the sounds of swords penetrating flesh echoing behind her. Once she caught up to the few remaining sisters of her order, they exited the passage well outside of the complex but much to their dismay, they turned to see what was once their home ablaze with knights riding about rounding up any survivors. The other sisters decided the best course of action would be to move with the cover of night and head towards a neighboring nation with a known sisterhood of Oghma. Sydna however could not ignore a growing pain and anger in her heart and so she opened her gift from her late mentor and frantically scanned the pages for a suitable god to call upon (as clearly she felt betrayed by Oghma for letting this happen). Her mind felt ashamed but her heart and eyes could not be pulled away from the entry on Shar, The Mistress of the Night and Lady of Loss. She called upon the goddess to smite the knights and lord that had caused her such pain and much to her dismay, the Mistress obliged. Sydna only remembers through her tears and sobs, a dark figure approaching her, wiping the drops off her face and asking \"do you promise to serve me? To seek vengeance against all who oppose me?\" And in her heart she replied yes. Shar entered Sydna then and began to lay waste to the remaining knights who had not returned to their castle, silent as a shadow and deadly as a storm. At dawn, Sydna awoke in the rubble of her fallen order, charred bodies she recognized and mutilated armored bodies she did not, lay about her in the destruction. Looking over her body, with new power coursing through her veins, she recognized Infernal script written all about her torso and upper arms. They state repeatedly \"I serve the night mother, I wield the shadow weave, and I will have my vengeance\". Looking out past the destruction, once again she saw the shadowy cloaked woman, but this time a large armor clad devil stood beside her. The devils form dissipated into shadowy smoke with hellfire burning throughout and rushed through Sydnas body. \"You are now bound in service to me, you will offer your accomplishments to me, and seek out the Order of the Dark Moon for greater truth and power\" spoke the lady, at which point she vanished. Sydna searched through the rubble for her mentor and retrieved a necklace to her former patron Oghma, in honor of her past. As she lit ceremonial incense for safe passing of her mentors soul, her body began to burn into black smoke. Sydna does not know if her mentors spirit passed on to Oghma through her ceremonial rites, or if she had damned her to servitude to Shar, but as such Sydna now offers souls to the god that she once knew, and the goddess she's now bound to and let's the dead settle their disputes. With no where to go nor anyone to turn to (as Sydna knows nothing of her past other than she was an orphan who was taken in by the sisterhood) she ventured out in hopes of finding the Order of the Dark Moon to obtain enough power to destroy the kingdom that wronged her and took away the only family she knew.\n",

I still don't know exactly what the spell was that she sold her soul for, she  just said that the success would help me and my children against the undead.

He was expected to study in many fields of knowledge, and while he was competent at fighting, he was far more interested in craftmanship and history. He became obsessed with old songs about his ancestors, the magic they wielded, and the adventures they went on. He started studying music and magic as much as he could, but his royal duties kept him from it. One day, his father asked him to lead an attack force against a group of orcs that had infested one of their deeper gem mines. It was nearly a failure, and the only reason the orcs were removed from the mine was the result of Trakul's father taking over at the last minute. Trakul was stripped of his royal title and cast out in disgrace, so he took the opportunity to study music and magic further. He made his way out of the mountains to a deep forest, where he came across a clan of elves. They initially wanted to reject him, but their royal bard took pity on Trakul and took him in. He trained with the royal bard for years, perfecting his craft by learning the lyre, learning musical spells, and ancient songs and tales of adventure. He also learned how to be a damn good entertainer as well. When Trakul left, his mentor gave him a magic lyre, a book of spells, and a word of advice: \"Be friendly to everyone, but trust no one.\" Trakul made a living as a traveling musician for a few years, but yearned to learn more songs. However, he could not find any, so he decided to write some of his own. For inspiration, he traveled with a group of adventurers and wrote songs about their exploits. He had to do a fair bit of adventuring himself, though, and he quickly acquired a taste for death-defying treasure hunts. So, as well as being a musician, he became an adventure-seeker as well.\n",

They told her that she had been saved, and granted new powers by Ioun, to track down the orc and exact ruthless vengeance on him.  This appalled Ceta.  She wanted rest, and quiet, and healing, and time to mourn.  Instead she was to be sent forth to enact violence and death.  Ceta felt she had no choice but to accept the quest of the goddess she had served for so long, the one who saved her life -- but she has grown bitter and cynical about it, and no longer feels any love for Ioun.

      "Output:\n",
      " _Hideyama Kurisuma is a true warrior. With strength, cunning, and leadership, he can best any foe. As a samurai, he goes against custom by being his own master. To most, he is a Ronin. Masterless. Without cause. Lost. But to him, it is more freeing than the greatest fight. Higher than the tallest mountain. Stronger than the hardest steel. Let us start where Hideyama's story began. He was born in a humble monastery in Quyu. Trained from the age of 3, he quickly mastered the art. By age 16, he was taken to the dragon temple, but did not succeed in being selected. His prowess, however, did not go unnoticed. A great samurai master, known as Ryku quickly took a liking to him, and trained him in the military arts. When Hideyama was 20, he fought his first battle, with a small group of bandits that had been harassing the locals. He continued like this for many months, then Ryku decided to teach him tactics. Hideyama, being a good student and eager to learn more, accepted the promotion to Lieutenant, and given a horse. He trained hard and long, and eventually, after 2 long, hard years of work, was granted his own small group of foot soldiers. After many successful raids, Hideyama's name was well known in the area. But the Emperor also took notice. A samurai that seemed to be sworn to no one. The Emperor sent envoys to meet this mysterious samurai, and offer him vassalage under the Emperor, the rightful ruler of the land. Hideyama was surprised that the Emperor had taken such notice, and accepted. His platoon was immediately moved to the temple of the Dragon in the Imperial city. His job was to oversee a small army that defended the city walls. It was a daunting task, but Hideyama accepted the challenge. Nothing eventful happened, until Lord Ido slaughtered the other Dragoneyes , the keepers of the peace, and Lord Sethos became the self proclaimed emperor 3 years later. Hideyama joined the rebellion, along with many of his troops. The battle to escape was long and bloody. Hundreds of good men died that day. Realizing his mistake in trusting that a vassalship would be beneficial to him, he vowed that he would be his own man. Sworn to no one. Commander of himself. He set out to find himself in the wilderness. On his journeys, he met several people. On his journey, he found a great and mighty temple. The monks there were kind to him, and noticed his damaged equipment. They granted him a set of armour, and a few weapons. First, a lordly set of samurai armour, faded red with gold lining, of great thickness. A long cavalry sword called an Odachi, a shorter sword called a Wazikashi, and a long spear with a rectangular banner on it called a Yari. He set off, and with these wapons did many great things. During his exile, there were a few people that stood out to him. His mentor in the woods, Hokichi Royama. A great sensei, and a master of forgotten techniques. Hideyama learned much about being a samurai, and learned the true weight of being a Ronin. His companion, for a time, a fellow ronin, Sakuraba Kojimo, who taught him the art of resisting mental and physical tortures. His Kenjutsu Hansi (master) who did not have a name, but helped him master Kenjutsu himself. His student, Kumage Shohei, whom he taught almost everything he knew, and sent off on his own path. When Hideyama emerged from his self induced exile, 18 years later, he was a changed man. His experiences had taught him much. At the ripe age of 43, his hair was graying, but he was ready. In the woods, he had learned of an ancient temple. One that would lead him to a new land, where civil unrest was unheard of. He searched for this temple for many years, almost losing hope before unearthing a new clue. From book, to artifact to unbelievable rumor, he searched. When he finally got a location, he has much time had passed. 4 long years he had searched, and finally it would come to fruition. He set out for the temple, and the journey was quite peaceful. As he climbed the steps, he began to wonder. What would this new land be like? Who would be in it? Would he be out of place in it? Would he be able to speak with the natives? These thought ran through his head, but did not deter him. He reached the temple. It was not very grand, in fact it was quite small. The temple looked like most other temples, but most of the ornamentation was gone, and the colours faded. The majesty that most temples have was absent. It felt like it had been abandoned, forgotten, or perhaps hidden. Hideyama entered the temple, and immediately was assailed by a horrible stench. His time with Sakuraba served him well, and he pressed on. At the end of the temple, there was a statue of the mirror dragon. He knelt at the statue, and rested for a time. He didnÕt know how long he sat there, but suddenly he felt like he was in a different place. The gods had granted his wish. He opened his eyes and looked around. He was in a large, circular room with a bar in the middle. The barÕs skirting and openings were reminiscent of the entrance to a temple. The walls were mosaics of red and gold. Hideyama was kneeling on a cushion at the bar. A portly white man walked up, and said with a subtle but distinct accent ÒHello. IÕm Mitchever, the barkeep. Can I get you anything to drink?Ó Hideyama was confused by this man, but did not let it show on his face, regardless of his mask. To be polite, he raised the mask and asked for some spring water. When his drink arrived, he inquired about this world, wondering if it was the haven he had been led to believe. Hideyama learned much in the next few hours, from Mitchever, and a few other patrons. But the most intriguing fact was the promise of great power, locked in a mysterious tower. The Tower of the Fool. It only appeared for short times, and quite infrequently. Hideyama felt that finding this power would teach him more about himself, and decided to wait for it to appear...\n",

Fire issued forth on his breath and into his hands, where he could shape it at will. He set about dispatching the baron's men, molding the flames into weapons that he found familiar; for the main part the weapons from the barroom brawls of his youth, most notably a bar stool, with the only exception being a simple fishing spear. The deed done, he had no choice but to flee, with only a fishing lure to remind him of his old life. If he stayed, his village would be he ones to suffer. So he made his way to a new land, where he found work as an adventurer. His hatred of injustice was refined over this journey, into something similar to modern-day socialism. And then came the battle with the harpies. He fought them off as best he could, but nevertheless found himself carried off, high into the sky. A more sensible man would wait until he'd reached the harpy's nest before slaying them, but Padraig was never especially sensible. Cushioning his fall with flame, he survived, but just barely. Too badly wounded to even move, he was easy prey for the werewolf. His new for hasn't impeded his powers in the slightest, merely changed the forms that he works the flames into. Gone are the weapons of the barroom brawler, replaced instead by more primal shapes; claws, fangs and even whole wolves of fire. His temperament has been similarly altered, his cheerful, open countenance displaying some... cracks, moments of savagery and aggression beyond anything he was capable of before. One thing is certain above all, however; one of these days, he'll go home. And when he does, that baron is fucked.\n",

But after this Rose began acting strangely, she spoke to the doctors in a language Bullworth had never heard, and was more rash and unsympathetic in her ruling. The doctors noticed Bullworth's suspicion and cornered him one day, they possesed his mind, and bullworth was trapped in a mental prison for weeks, but was eventually led back to consciousness by Osiris. He left the palace as soon as this happened, knowing there were forces at play here that he wasn't yet ready to face, and devoted himself to osirsis, vowing to one day return and rid his kingdom of the evil that plagues it \n",

The psychic television show format had proven relatively successful, and who doesn't love puppies!? She wasn't convinced she was a psychic but after several years she had already committed so much it would be too much to just drop the act. The turning point of her career was when she had a show about the curing power that love and compassion can have. On this controversial episode, she found a local suburban home where their dog was getting really sick. \"Place your hands. Like this. Firmly there between Chomper's shoulders.\" Ruth and the mother of the house gently touched Chomper's back. \"Now feel all the love you can feel! Feel the love I feel. Feel the love you have for Chompers, your kids, your husband!\" The mother looked to her children who were standing a distance crying, and looked back at the dog. After but a moment Ruth's hand glowed an almost imperceptible divine light. Chomper's health had improved! He lifted his little chihuahua snout and wagged his tail lying there on the doggy bed. The religiously inclined condemned the show, but the controversy brought in a wider audience, and with it more supporters. She continued to do shows like this, until she caught the attention of the Shroud of Colors.

When Pio's mother died after being 3 months in critical condition, he fled for the forest, running from his father who had turned to drinking and became abusive. He looked for answers and prayed to Silva. He survived off the wild for 6 years before his first non-animal contact since leaving Rom, a large robot, that seemed to be lost was bulldozing its way through the forest making a huge amount of noise. Pio spoke with the robot and lead it to his shelter, where he began inspecting it and poking and prying. He realized that the robot was sentient and came from the dwarvish town of Jun. Pio and the Large Robot that proclaimed himself as \"The Bulwark\" returned to Rom and began ridding the streets of the gangs and violent thugs. He found his father in the same state as he had saw his mother just before leaving. Pio could barely recognize his dying father covered in dirt on the side of the road. He did everything he could, but to no prevail. After he had lost everything, him and Bulwark travelled to Unn and began a new life, even though he is gone from his home-town, Pio often thinks that it is his fault that his father is dead, and that he hasn't made either of his parents proud and therefore does everything to please their dying wishes of him living, and to honor their memories.\n",

He often had to make his own presents out of the boxes and wrappings of his brother's and sister's presents. This led to a lifelong love of building contraptions.  When he grew of age, he decided to take his knowhow out into the world.  Times were hard for Rube.  Nobody seemed to have need of the quirky inventions he had created.  One day, while near death from starvation, a rat ran over his boot as he lay in the gutter.  Too weak to chase the rat, he tied together bits of iron and bricks that were lying around.  The next time the rat came to nibble on his feet, he unleashed his trap dropping a large brick on the rat's head, after a long series of events that started with a simple tug of a string.  Weeks went by, and Rube expanded his trap, adding pulleys, weights, and counterweights to it to increase its efficiency.  As the years went by, he had several run-ins with the local mafia, wanting him to come work for them and to build traps for their hideout.  But that wasn't the life Rube wanted.  One day, the mafia decided if he wasn't going to work for them, he wouldn't work for anyone and put a bounty on his head.  12 toughs showed up to his door, but with quick thinking and guile, Rube dispatched them all quickly by fashioning several devious traps.  From that day forward, he decided to travel the countryside helping those in need whenever he could.\n",

As her first assignment, she was posted to a garrison in a remote village, not far from the border of the land. Undermanned and mismanaged, the garrison took constant hits from raiding parties. It was clear that leadership was lacking, so Leif rose to fill the position. She quickly advanced through the ranks, and was eventually trusted with managing the garrison in this remote outpost. There, she befriended a priest of Gorm Gulthyn, who showed her the strength of faith and the power gained through it, and taught her the ways of his god: watchfulness, vigilance, defense, protection of the dwarven people. As her faith grew stronger, so did her friendship with the cleric, Angal. Until one day, when her world was turned upside down. A duergar raiding party, catching the garrison completely by surprise, massacred the population of the village and captured the few high-ranking individuals residing there, torturing them to extract information, killing them when they were done. Leif was taken aside to be questioned, discovering that the one who betrayed the garrison was her friend, the priest. Instead of taking her life, he let her go. That day, she swore an oath in the name of her god - not Angal's god anymore, as he had clearly betrayed him too. An oath of vengeance: in Gorm Gulthyn's name she would find and strike down those that dared defile it, and dared threaten the safety of the dwarven people.\n",
